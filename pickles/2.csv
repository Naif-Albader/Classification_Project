0,"Its sad that one of the best TV shows of all time concluded the way it did. The ending wasn't bad, but the 7 season buildup only to have this mad dash to the end is awful. Nothing was explained, nothing was written well, terrible pacing! Absolutely disrespectful to fans! This last season makes it really hard to recommend the show to new viewers or repeat viewings. If the writers didn't care why should we?",3,24 May 2019,2502,2722
1,"Dear Dan and Dave,I have long been a huge fan and an avid supporter of Game of Thrones all the way since Season 1, granted I regretfully have not had the joys of reading any of the wonderful George RR Martins books. I have, however spent hundreds of hours exploring the Game of Thrones lore, history of Westeros, fan theories, detailed interviews and everything in-between - It's fair to say I'm a more passion fan than most.I am no Hollywood writer - or in fact any writer for that matter - but I believe I share the opinion of so many GoT fans. I want to start off by saying thank you. Thank you to the visual effects crew, stunt co-ordinators, body doubles, extras, set designers, costume designers, camera men, George RR Martin, directors, the brilliant actors and so many other people behind the scenes of this once all-time great show - Not only have we the fans been incredibly let down, but the people who have put their physical blood, sweat and tears into the show have also had their beautiful hard work defiled.I could go into incredible detail about all the things wrong with this season, some notable events: Jon being exiled for killing Danny who murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people, Jon's heritage being seemingly not important, the woeful execution of Danny going mad, Bran being king even though he didn't do anything at all, Drogon flying off into the 'sunset', Rhaegal being killed, missing the reaction of Sansa and Arya's when Jon revealed his real parents and most of all for me, no one sticking up for Jon in the meeting with all the powerful lords... He literally killed the woman he loved and saved countless lives in the process and he gets nothing in return, its shameful.With the holes in the show - and there as so many - I think it's a pathetic excuse of an ending. HBO wanted 10 seasons, but foolishly Dan Weiss and David Benioff decided they had enough, they wanted to wrap the show up so they could make mountains of money butchering yet another beloved franchise (Star Wars). I understand that not everything deserves a happy and perfect ending, nor can you please everyone. However, we spent nearly a decade following these wonderful characters, watching them develop and intelligently interact with each other since season 1. The ending to this show will never be forgotten, for the wrong reasons unfortunately. I hope Dan and David come out and apologise to the fans, we are the people that kept the show running, without the fans support there would have been no Game of Thrones on TV at all.The characters deserved better. The whole crew deserved better. The fans deserved better. George deserved better.Regards,A Game of Thrones fan",1,20 May 2019,14332,15751
2,"The Good things:
Music. Better than ever.Work Behind Cameras. It can´t be denied.Acting, despise of the poor writing.Arya, the Hound and Jorah were the few characters who behaved consistent.The Bad Things:
S08E01 and S08E02 filler episodes with dumb fan services scenes.S08E03 was a joke. Nobodody saw anything thanks to HBO, the Night king was a joke, everybody had plot armor, a lot of dumb fan service scenes, nothing really happened that affected the lore in the long term.. Dothraki´s charge was just stupid. The entire plan to defend Winterfell sucked.
Bran made no sense the entire season. We never really understood his purpose. Why did he warg during the battle of winterfell?S08E04, another filler episode. Euron´s fleet was full of Hawkeyes.So DAENERYS kinda forgot about Euron. Really????S08E05, Euron´s fleet became a bunch of Stormtroopers.So Daenerys destroyed the entire fleet with no problems at all. Why didn´t she do that in S08E04 after they killed her dragon? The ships were attacking her fleet, so she could easily flied up and then she justo does the dive bombing thing. Euron could have still survived, killed a dragon, and he coul still capture MESSUNDAE in the beach. The he could have said to Cersei ""We lost half our fleet but we killed a Dragon and captured this girl"".So the city surrenders easily, and Daenerys became Anakin Skywalker. Made no sense. It made sense for her to become the mad queen, but not that way.So what´s the point of the letters that Varys wrote? Useless.S08E06, so nobody mentions that Jon is the true heir to the throne, not even during the election of a new king.Daenerys´s death was cheesy.During the election of the new king and during the council reunion, GOT turned into a Sitcom, a bad one.Jon was ruined this season. He was foolish, dumb and with bad lines.Tyrion was like Sherlock Holmes during S01-S06. He turned into Lestrade.Bronn´s arc made no sense.Sadly, Euron´s arc made no sense at all.So Cersei and Jaimie could have survived if they wanted. they just needed to move a little.I could go on...",2,20 May 2019,5351,5974

5,"Ozai is defeated by Sokka halfway through the final season. Aang never actually uses the other elements for anything and just stands around uselessly. Zuko then declares that he never cared about his honor, abandons team Avatar and goes back to join Azula, then they both get killed by falling bricks. Toph completely forgets about metal bending and never uses it again despite plenty of situations where it would've obviously been useful. All the Airbenders are inexplicably back for the final battle despite all being dead. Katara goes crazy and destroys Ba Sing Se before being killed by Aang. Momo then becomes the new Firelord. Then the show ends with Aang just walking off and going back into the iceberg. What a let-down.",2,3 July 2020,256,283
6,"Season 8 broke my heart. Years and years of build-up, of laughter, tears, despair and happiness, after falling in love with many characters and their arcs and passionately hating some others, my favourite show ever got ruined completely.The disappointment and sadness were so monumental, that I really asked myself 'what is happening here!?' And I found the answer. I felt like after wonderful years in a beautiful relationship, the love of my life broke up with me. Suddenly. Via SMS. Without explaining anything. Without collecting their things.And I still find belongings here and there. And I'm still mourning and lovesick. It will take a while longer I guess...",3,6 July 2019,797,900
7,"Oh my. It was like a High School drama class was given access to the GOT sets and allowed to act out their own little scripts.Where were the characters? GONE! Wonderful characters. NOT THERE! Jon Snow was so bland as to be almost lobotomized. Bron, Sam, Davos, Sansa, Arya, Yara Greyjoy, Brienne - all sitting around in that nothing scene - it was like the actors were there, but no one had given them any lines for their characters; because all the characters had disappeared into some talent sucking ether.To say the dialogue was like in a bad soap opera is too generous.Clear D&D just wanted to get this over with. This series should have ended with Season 6.So sad. So sad.",1,20 May 2019,6319,7310

12,"Forget all subplots, forget mystery around the White Walkers, forget The Faceless Men, Jon's heritage, forget that there once was logic and common sense in the series.
The show lost everything George R.R. Martin created - a complex world of utter fantasy and everyday life with politics, war strategies and basic human needs combined in a beautiful and authentic saga which you wish would never come to an end.
And the showrunners did everything in their power to ruin it. What a shame.3 stars for the music, actors' performance and a tearful last scene of Drogon with Dany.",3,20 May 2019,4273,5060
13,"8 seasons. Supernatural creatures from beyond the wall, a prophesy, the many faced god, the lord of light, dragons, battles, magic, mythology. None of it mattered.It was all so Westeros could switch from a monarchy to a committee. Yep. That was what the whole thing was about. Gods literally returned people from the dead so they could switch to a committee.The best programme on TV has the worst ending I've ever seen. They wanted it finished, they didn't know how to end it, so they cobbled together a few fan theories and abandoned the entire history of the show.Absolutely awful.",1,15 October 2019,381,441

18,"We left behind a year in which the fans had been waiting a long time, ran from theories to theories, brainstormed and all expectations were destroyed in the 8th season. At some point, I can almost say that I was almost happy to say the series is over. Why does such a series end up so bad? Character development was ignored. Very big disappointment. It would be better if Drogon and Ghost made sex in the final.I would have preferred a finale that was left open but created a big effect. We didn't need to know what was happening to every character, that they were all happy and strong. Almost democracy was coming. I couldn't see the finale that was bittersweet. The creators of the series once again proved how unsuccessful they were without a source. You can see this difference in diplomatic sentences easily by opening a random episode from the first three to four seasons of the series. 1/10",1,20 May 2019,3800,4773

24,"If you're giving any of these episodes a 10/10, defending it unconditionally because you think this is what game of thrones is, you're very sadly mistaken and need to go back to watching Disney's Star Wars movies because you're devoid of recognizing any semblance of quality story telling. I've been with this show from the very beginning. I watched in awe as Ned Stark was beheaded, the red wedding came to a bloody climax, Jon Snow was betrayed and stabbed to death for doing what he thought was right. None of that was 'subverting my expectations.' It was good, quality storytelling that stayed consistent with the progression of each character's storyline and showed who the characters were and would do. In this last season, we've seen characters act out in ways that are completely inconsistent with how they've acted the entire series prior. We watched the story arcs of Jaime, the hound, and Dany all become completely null and void. We watched Jon Snow become a glorified extra, demanding the question why he was even brought back from the dead. We watched the night king become a B-movie villain. We watched the character assassinations of greats like Varys, Cersei, and Tyrion. We did not get one semblance of a satisfactory ending and there's nothing you can say that will justify this lazily thrown together abomination that is game of thrones season 8. This show now officially has the worst ending of any show in the history of television and we're right to be angry.",1,20 May 2019,2673,3478
25,How can I rate this less than 1 star please?Seriously. Terrible.,1,20 May 2019,32,36
26,Season 8 has been a complete disappointment.The final episode is a disgrace. The way they have butchered story lines such as us seeing Dany for 7 seasons being trained how to rule to suddenly becoming the Mad Queen. Jon whose only purpose is to say uh dunt wunt it and has been borderline useless since he was resurrected.The finale is what a 14 year old fanfic would end it as.D&D ruined the series as soon as they ran out of material from GRRM.,1,20 May 2019,2455,3232

32,"I can't help but think the show probably would've benefited greatly if they had just decided to leave out the Night King and the White Wallers/Army of the Dead entirely. They ended up being completely useless and underwhelming in the end anyway. Had they left that out and just focused on the fighting between the different houses, we might've actually ended up with a decent ending to this show. Instead, we got a rushed mess of a final season that tried to hurry up and get the AotD out of the way and then hurry up and end the rest of the story. I didn't dislike the direction the show went so much, just the cheap and terribly rushed way it got there. Everything just seemed so rushed that it didn't feel organic or anywhere nearly as clever as previous seasons. In short, the final two seasons were just a rushed mess with no real substance. We deserved better.",3,12 June 2019,184,236
33,It's like i wasted my time and energy to watch the show just to get this totally pathetic ending. I really don't have a words to explain how messed up with the ending. I wish i would give -ve ratings to this finale.,1,3 October 2020,27,31
34,"I regret watching season 8. I felt let down and betrayed. The time and emotions I invested in this story were a waste. Nothing made sense. I know real life can be hopeless, ugly, and unfair. The reason I immerse myself in story is to look for hope, beauty, reward. The creators of game of thrones, were arrogant and violated the trust of their fans. They exceeded their remit as story tellers, and went on a egoistic and self-important journey to..mediocrity. The WWII simplistic allegory was especially laughable and ironic, getting drunk with power and blinded by previous success, is exactly what happened to the show makers.",1,8 June 2019,136,175
35,"The end of GOT could have been the best ever in the history of movie and TV. Because of the 7 seasons before they have created an incredible amount of potential. So how can you fail so much? I really think D&D just did not feel like it anymore. Because otherwise I can not explain the statements of D&D in the Inside the Episodes of the episodes S8E4 & S8E5. The statements were so disturbing that it can only be that. We all know the examples .... GRRM wanted 12 seasons HBO wanted 10 but D&D just wanted Starwars ... why else only 6 episodes? No time and interest in logical connections and logical character development. We all know the examples ...... In the end, the worst decision was made for each scenario. I could not enjoy S8E4, S8E5 and S8E6. It was agony. But suppose we leave E4 like that and go on from here. If you want the mad queen plotline do it right. Daenerys conquers the throne after the capitulation of Kings Landing without burning the city. She becomes queen and rules. She has finally made it but the success tastes more than bittersweet. She lost everything. she is still in deep sadness. Out of this sadness and other key experiences then arises the mad queen in season 9. Arya and Sansa will then be right and she will see in Jon's true identity a threat, etc. Here you could then additionally reveal jaqen h'ghar as rhaegar targaryen. GRRM loves these traingle relationships. This time we have a quadrilateral relationship. Daenerys as a sister. Jon as a son and Arya as a student. In Season 9, everything comes together game of thrones stands for. add couple more genius ideas. voila ! best season ever (Emilia voice)Even if we leave it at the 6 episodes then do it also right and use the azor ahai prophecy: Let S8E1 & S8E2 do the same. Just as well S8E3 except Night King flys to kingslanding. He kills everyone in kingslanding and increase his army. Then give Cercei her epic dead personally by the Night King. At the same time Winterfell defends the dead and white walker. They kill the remaining white walker instead of the Night King. S8E4 they lick their wounds and realize that they have won the battle but not the war and now 1 Million Undead are running for the Final Fight to Winterfell. S8E5 Final Fight starts. many dead. ends with bad moment. S8E6 Jon can only stop the Night King by fulfilling the prophecy of azor ahai. He can only make the sword of Lightbringer by ramming the sword into the heart of Nissa Nissa That's where Daenerys come into play. Like Jon she is the reincarnation of nissa nissa. Bittersweet he has to kill the love of his life to defeat the Night King. EPIC FIGHT azor ahai vs nightking. Jon wins he rules as Aegon Tagaryan aka azor ahai. And Bran aka ""why do you think i came all this way"" serves as hand of the king.

36,"How could you make Dani out to be this crazy woman with a mental illness? Just because her father was looney doesn't mean she has to be. Never in 7 seasons did they show us that possibility.Anyhow, I'm sure no one will be reading this and I doubt I can say anything that already hasn't been said. This goes down without a doubt as the most disappointing final seasons and especially the horrendous finale. I hate to walk away with such a bad taste on my mouth....Is there any chance we could have a reset, much like the TV show Dallas did when they originally killed off Bobby and then brought him back when the public outcry was so loud. Can we do the same here? Make this last episode a Jon Snow nightmare, all created in his mind.",1,5 October 2020,22,25

A queen is killed in a room with zero bodyguards in yet another highly unsatisfying scene.Writing will unfortunately go down in history as an ultimate bad example of how not to write. It's almost like they tried to do their worst for a bet or something, completely unexplainable.

58,"I truly never have been more disappointed than with this finale. Imagine not being capable of interpreting any of GRRM books and figure out any of the plot lines he had laid out in his books to come up with a finale that gave this characters a more satisfying ending. For example Daenerys. I can deal with my favorite character becoming the villain, but give her the character development she deserved. She went from savior to killer in less than 20 min... DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED WITH BRAN THE BROKEN. Wasn't this kid up in Winterfell telling everyone he could not be the lord of anything. Did that mean all he wanted was to be the king all along? How in the hell does this kid end up on the non existent Iron Throne? Also, nepotism much? So Bran becomes king, and his sister miss Im always right Sansa demands the north's independence?!? Im sorry was Yara not at that meeting deciding who was going to become king? If the 2 so call writers had put a little effort into what they were writing, maybe they would've understood that yara would not have kept her mouth shut and she would've fought for her independence. Like, really? Also not longer after the show ended the 2 ""writers"" were at a conference talking about how they tried to make the fantasy aspect of this fantasy show based on high fantasy novels less fantastical. Make it make sense. The problem in all of this is that Dan & Dave where just not capable of continuing GRRM's story telling on their own. They were lost in the spectacle of subverting expectations that they forgot to actually continue telling Mr. Martin's story. They wanted to move on and end this great show that probably could've gone to new show runners that actually knew a better way on how to end this amazing show. All I can say is that I hope d&d stick to adapting finished work, and hopefully they stay away the GOT cinematic universe!",1,3 May 2021,16,19

I had high hopes for a satisfying ending even after the 8x1-5 episodes but now i only feel sad and disappointed.

They was nothing and they did nothing.Also the real name of Jon Snow was useless, and they did not mentionned it in the election.They put Bronn the killer in the small concil, but not Jon.Daenerys, as the mad queen, was a new character, she has spent her entire life to help the poors, and she burnt children...The long night was too short...with no giant spiders.I'm sad and waiting for the books now.",1,7 June 2021,13,15

65,"I would rate this as 0 but I'll allow the 1 star for Drogon taking his dead mother away. That was the only decent 3 seconds of this whole season.I actually did laugh out loud at the 'Bran as king' storyline. Literally spat my tea out. This season seems to be a lot of, ""well we wanted to take the story in this direction but it won't work and we don't know how to so quickly lets make something up along the way.""Gone was the storyline of Jon's heritage! End of 8 years waiting results in the 2 big threats, Night King and Cersei Lannister, being wiped out by Danaerys. Something nobody else could have done. And to thank her? The North kills her off. Nobody mourns her death nor seeks justice for it and the power hungry Sansa throws Jon under the bus and refuses to bend the knee to her own brother so she can become a queen of somewhere.How nobody commented on the awfulness of Sansa baffles me. She has always been a power hungry, arrogant, selfish, manipulative person who somehow comes up smelling of roses despite committing treason.This whole season has been utterly appalling. Years of waiting to hear about the Night King wiped out in a second by a flying Arya who somehow possesses supernatural abilities. Years of following Cersei's torture of everyone, only to have her ending rushed in a ridiculous way. No thought gone into the complete transformation of Dany.I was really hoping someone had dreamt the whole thing and would wake up in a bed back in season 6 before everything started to go downhill. Utter rubbish. I've never seen such a bad ending to such a good show.",1,20 May 2019,479,738

It could have been good. Instead it was...bad. Just bad.Even after all this time, I have no other words for it, honestly. It was a total disappointment. My heart genuinely goes out to the cast and crew for their hard work and dedication. I hope nobody is blaming them for this mess.I would've loved a better ending for Cersei. Her death was a total cop-out.Seven seasons of build-up of the Night King and eternal winter, for one incredibly dark, poorly written, senseless episode.Sansa becoming queen was ""fan"" service? (assuming she has fans, of course.) I'll never understand how the girl that cannot even figure out how to use a knife is apparently fit to be queen. It was ridiculously cringe-worthy. Poor writing all around.Daenerys deserved a better end to her story. Again, the arc should've been drawn out; the idea of her finally snapping because of all she's been through makes sense, but it was done so badly that it was just terrible to watch. I feel so bad for Emilia.The writers very clearly didn't know what to do with their characters. The intelligent ones were dumbed down, the warrior ones were made useless, the plot armour was unbelievable-- this has all been said before. It was just BAD.All in all: not worth watching. In fact, it ruins the rest of the series, too, knowing how it ends. Super disappointed!",1,22 July 2020,12,14
73,"This was the second time Game of Thrones made me cry. First time during Season 6 episode 10 - Winds of Winter. But that was tears of joy, this was just plain sad.
This episode does not deserve a complex review, I put about as much thought into this as D&D did making this worthless piece of garbage. I sincerely hope Star Wars flops and that they never get another job in this industry.

D and D screwed up every single plot and ruined most of the characters because they wanted to rush off to ruin star wars as well. After all was said and done I realised I wasn't even sad when Jon killed Dany, I didn't care anymore. There were so many plot holes... why wasn't Jon killed by Greyworm after he murdered Dany? why did Jon have to go to the nights watch when the unsullied had left the continent? Why didn't Yara demand independence of the iron islands after Sansa claimed the north as independent just as she did in s6 with Dany? This finale was laughable so much so that it became a sitcom in the end. Bran has the best story? all the lords and ladies in the 7 kingdoms just agree this weird kid from the north is their king now when they know nothing about him? Arya just leaves when her WHOLE arc is about getting back to her pack, Sansa gets what she wanted all along and never had any development as a character after all she had been through? They didn't even tie up basic subplots like the Arya/Gendry romance or what happened to the Dothraki after their khaleesi died (even though it was essentially the end of the Dothraki during the battle of winterfell and they all magically showed up again alive and well after dany conquered king landing) I will never get over this, for many of us this was more then a TV show and they butchered it! not allowing fans to speak at comic con and D&D not showing up just shows that they know they screwed up and are too cowardly to hear the backlash from disappointed fans.",1,21 July 2019,45,65

The biggest one being Jaime's apparent return to the clutches of treacherous, manipulative, and abusive Cersei (who, by the way, tried to murder Jaime). Apparently D & D forgot all logic and thought that it made sense sending Jamie back into the arms of the woman who tried to kill him, left him to die, and who has murdered countless innocents. And ""why does he return?"" you may ask. Well, because *they're family.* Oh. My. God. Give me break. Not even in a fantasy world would a man return to a woman who tried to have him killed.

I don't really buy this sudden madness of ""Dany"" and it looks bad in show which started to struggle with lack of intrigue, loss of character identity, immortality of main characters, teleportation and other things, to make madness another unlogical factor in the plot.Dragon decides to melt the Iron Throne, to brag that he can destroy it, as it was hinted multiple times in previous seasons. It looked incredibly stupid, but was quickly matched by meeting of nobles which felt like a parody. Don't tell me that actors always do great job and it's only the writers. Acting was abysmal in this scene.Overall there could be a really solid Season 7 and Season 8 with the most important plot outcomes preserved, but writers were unable to reasonably glue the pieces which George R.R.

110,"All the reviews are right. The show (as a whole) was great. Seasons 1-4 were phenomenal. Season 5 was flawed, but redeemed itself in the end. Season 6 was great, and has one of the great reveals of the entire show with ""The Door"". The last two episodes are perhaps the best two, as well. Then there's Season 7. It has some silly stuff. It values spectacle over story. The ""Beyond the Wall"" episode is filled with lazy writing and plot holes. But it's still, as a whole, highly entertaining with some incredible moments and scenes. ""The Spoils of War"" is a fantastic episode, and the season ends on a high note.Then we get to season 8. The first 2 episodes are fine. In fact, episode 2 has some fantastic writing. Episode 3 is when things start to go downhill, and the last three episodes are the single worst stretch of writing in an otherwise good show that I have ever seen. It's almost hard to comprehend how much this ball was fumbled. It's the equivalent of following up The Dark Knight with Batman & Robin.I've seen some defenses of these final episodes, with fans saying that people would have been disappointed no matter what happened and that people just like to whine. While it's true that people online like to whine about things, I have two responses...1) Breaking Bad season 5 says hello. The Lord of the Rings trilogy says hello. Even Avengers: Endgame says hello. There are plenty of shows and movies that had astounding hype and somehow lived up to or even exceeded that hype. Breaking Bad season 4 was so incredible that it seemed the show was destined to end on a bit of a down note. Instead, somehow, the show ended with a final season so strong that I don't think it's hyperbole to describe Breaking Bad as possibly the greatest storytelling achievement of the 21st century so far.2) Yes, Season 8 was (unnecessarily) rushed. Yes, they ran out of books. But even with only 6 episodes, there is so much more they could have done with that real estate. Just as a fan, I can take those same 6 episodes and rework them into something much better. I can even use a lot of the same ""moments"", and in fact, everything up to S08E03 would be the same. Season 7, despite its flaws, would be the same, as would the first two episodes of Season 8. I think if the show had gone this route, while still a little rushed, most people would have been very satisfied... and Game of Thrones would have gone down as an all time great.So how should it have ended?Well, in The Long Night, I would have the Night King win. Those not fighting him are staying in the large main hall of Winterfell, rather than the crypts. They then have to escape *through* the crypts once it becomes clear that they're going to lose. To do this, they have to fight the undead, but they now have no choice. The last shots of Ep. 3 would be our main characters (including Bran) retreating as the Night King advances and takes over Winterfell. Theon still dies, staying behind to buy them a little bit of time.Then in Ep. 4, they continue retreating as we watch the army of the dead conquer and take over villages on its way to King's Landing. The retreating forces arrive in King's Landing, with Jon and Daenerys on dragons, and they warn Cersei that they probably have two days before the Night King arrives. Discussing strategy and the catastrophic losses in Winterfell, Sam has an idea. They need to destroy the Weirwood trees to make the Night King vulnerable. It seems impossible, as there are too many trees spread out over Westeros, but Bran can help them. They don't actually have to destroy all of the trees, only one. The tree they need to destroy is the one where the old Three-Eyed Raven lived. They need to burn it with a special type of fire that only the Lord of Light can provide. However, by doing this, Bran will lose his ""sight"" and memory and possibly die. It's a risk worth taking. Bran begins to tell them major events so they can write them down (and thus not 'forget' everything), and Jon takes a few select characters (including Melisandre and Ser Davos) by dragon toward the tree. Bran shows them the way with ravens. Meanwhile, Daenerys stays behind to help protect King's Landing with Drogon. The people of King's Landing prepare for battle, as the Night King is basically building a massive ice bridge over the water directly to King's Landing. At the end of Ep. 4, he arrives.In Ep. 5, a massive battle takes place against the Night King at King's Landing (the city is aptly named). As this happens, the Weirwood tree is sought out by Jon and friends, while during the battle it's still almost impossible to get to the Night King. Eventually the Night King appears to be close to winning, approaching Bran (similar to the actual ending in Ep. 3). Meanwhile, we watch Jon and friends get to the tree and fight the undead to reach its roots. The Red Witch Melisandre helps them to do this, and without her and her connection to the Lord of Light they would not succeed. Suddenly, just as the Night King approaches Bran, his face goes blank. Jon and friends have done it, they've destroyed the tree. The Night King - so close to his moment of triumph - realizes what has happened, and he kills Bran in an act of vengeful fury. Arya now jumps at him from the shadows (in a scene similar to the actual show). He grabs her, but she stabs him using the same move from the actual show. Since he's now vulnerable, he dies. It's official. The Night King is dead. Winter is over.It's a moment of genuine triumph. At the burning Weirwood tree, the Red Witch drops her necklace and dies, like she did at the end of Ep. 3 in the actual show (with Ser Davos still watching her in these final moments). It's almost hard to believe. The Long Night has ended. Except - in this moment of triumph, Cersei makes her move. She has her men turn their scorpions on Drogon, injuring him as Daenerys suddenly has to defend herself while many are still celebrating. It's chaos and confusion. In her rage at being attacked and betrayed right after their moment of victory, Daenerys and an injured Drogon attack King's Landing. Drogon is able to destroy the scorpions, though he is further injured in the process, and in the chaos and anger of the moment she keeps using him to burn the rest of the city. Her (justifiable) rage is out of control. The Night King wasn't able to destroy the city, but Daenerys can and she does. Ep. 5 ends with Drogon crashing down into the throne room, where Cersei has retreated. Cersei sits proudly and defiantly on the Iron Throne. ""Dracarys!"" Cersei is burned alive, and the throne melted down, in imagery similar to the actual destruction of the throne in Ep. 6. After this, Drogon now dies of his injuries, and ash rains down from the sky like it did in the vision from the end of Season 2.Ep. 6 begins with Jon returning to King's Landing on Rhaegal. He is shocked to see that the city is now burning ruins. Daenerys has retreated, and Jon goes to find her. Once he does, she expresses anger and then regret over what happened, and worries that she is no better than her father. Jon has an opportunity to take over from here and defeat her, but he refuses. Rhaegal is also still loyal to Daenerys over him. Jon is horrified, but also understands the shocking treachery of Cersei's actions. He tells Daenerys that he cannot condemn her, and that she is still his queen. So what happens? Thanks to Tyrion - who is also horrified by the burning of King's Landing but also equally horrified by Cersei's deception - they ultimately decide to divide up power. Daenerys will take Rhaegal and rule over the South and the former slave cities. Sansa will rule the North, while Jon will become the new Mance Rayder and rule the Free Folk beyond (what used to be) the Wall. The fact that he and Sansa are on the same page will mean the North is pretty much united. Meanwhile, King's Landing will need a new 'king', even if this person will not actually rule all of the Seven Kingdoms. Sam might suggest democracy as he did in the actual finale, and be laughed off, but then the other lords decide Tyrion should be the new king. He accepts. It was clear that he couldn't really continue to advise Daenerys after her violent actions, and more importantly: he's back ""home"". This is where he belongs. (An alternate to this idea could be that Tyrion would be the Hand to the new king, someone who would basically be a figurehead.)The episode could still end with the same image of Jon heading into the woods with the Free Folk, but it now has different context. Daenerys is neither a pure hero or villain, and she is actually humbled by her moment of rage; one that is more justified than in the actual show. Old grudges remain, but after all the death and destruction of the last few episodes, people want to move forward. The world is forever changed, and for the moment, the game of thrones is over. The Night King is defeated, power divided up, and a new era begun.TL;DR version: No excuses, Game of Thrones blew it.",2,25 December 2019,21,29

After creating so much hype about Jon Snow being the true king, he's sent back to the North forever! WTH! The only decent episode in the last season was the war with the white walkers.

I gotta give it to the writers (Dumb and Dumber) they managed to one up themselves every episode in terms of how BAD it was, it's insane.
So basically they wrapped up material that could've last episodes in mere 70 minutes, and boy did they f it up.
Nothing makes sense, why would Drogon just stare at Jon after killing his ''Mother'', why would he go, ''F this char in particular'' on the iron throne. Why would they vote Bran who has done NOTHING at all for king, and why would he/them deem it fit to call him ''Bran the broken''. Why have they rushed Dany going mad which could've worked if they eased into it over the course of a season/seasons (consisting of 10 episodes ofcourse) instead of her going crazy over some bells.
Why would Jon be tasked with leading the Night's watch when the Night's watch no longer has a purpose. (No threat to the realms of men)
Never mind the fact that he just nopes out of there because he knows there's nothing to protect, but the writers don't.
And for the love of all that is sacred, they let Bronn be master of coin for the sake of fanservice, what does he know about managing a kingdom treasury ?
Why would Sansa be able to claim the north as a seperate kingdom without any objections from the others, nepotism i guess.

115,"With the development of Season 8 in the back of one's mind, it was clear that we won't get any change of this bad writing in the last episode. Beside this fact, the end is not that bad in theory and was forth-shadowed in the last episodes.Sadly the 10/10 boys here don't get that the 1/10 voters are not whining about the storyline overall and that some prophecies didn't get fulfilled. No, it's just complaining about HOW we get there. But the rating has become a religious war, cause considering all the positive things (music, acting, cgi, costumes... all the things the crew put tons of work, time and love in) you can't rate this 1/10, as well as you can't rate this 10/10 due to the bad writing and considering the overall context of the show.So here is how I came to my rating:
*Music & Acting (regardless what they where forced to act): 10/10
*Engineering (CGI, Costumes, Setting): 9/10
*Storyline (regardless that it was rushed): 6/10

In fact, there is no point in watching after ep3 as the story arc and character development go for a toss. Cersei did not get the prophesied end and Danaerys...can't even explain. No amount of explanation can describe her character twist - similar to, however you explain, ep3 was much darker (cinematography) than needed.

And i thought tbat season 8 will even top my expectations .. we're supposed to be having the greatest battles ahead.. the great war with tbe dead.. the war for the iron throne.

124,"Wow. So to start off I need to make this clear, I don't hate the actors or the crew who made this show and as far as I can see no one is berating them for the amazing effort they put forward. They deserve all the credit in the world for making this loot-train-wreck watchable.We are berating the WRITERS for not putting in REMOTELY the same amount of EFFORT.I love Kit Harrington as Jon Snow, I don't want to be here writing about how the writers made him a glorified extra in his own story and gave him a catchy new 1-liner! Here's an excerpt from the show:Jon Snow: ""SHE'S MY QUEEN""Tyrion Lannister: ""... Jon... ar- are you ok? Did you get hit in the head during the sack? Did you see her burn down the city for literally no reason at all? Like she didn't even go for Cercei...""Jon Snow: ""SHE'S MY QUEEN""Tyrion Lannister: ""DUDE. She MOWED people down street by street. She thought the right thing to do was PERSONALLY MURDER surrendering men, women, & children... *sigh* Jon. You once were killed for doing what you believed was the right thing. How can you reconcile-""Jon Snow: ""SHE'S MUH QUEEN""I love Lena Headey as Cercei Lannister, I don't want to be here writing about how the writers essentially made her impotent the second she blew up the frigging' Sept of Baelor and then didn't give her anything to do with her own baby sub-plot.I love Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark, I don't want to be here writing about how the writers made her & Masie Williams Arya so stupid they nearly fall for Little Finger's OBVIOUS ploy. For all the talk of Sansa being a great political player, and talk of Arya being this amazing assassin, they nearly fall for the lie of a man these SISTERS both don't trust.I love Emilia Clark as Daenerys Targaryen, I don't want to be here writing about how the writers made her so angry, stupid, and crazy she goes FULL HITLER after she WON & BURNS women and children alive?... What the hell happened to her not wanting to be queen of the ashes?? Why couldn't we get a fleshed out decent into madness that makes sense so I could EMPATHIZE with her? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GREYJOY FLEET??? I GUESS SHE FORGOT ABOUT THEM.I love Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, I don't want to be writing about how the writers turned him into an IDIOT. A mind needs books like a sword needs a wet stone, huh? Did Tyrion stop reading The Art of War and pick up a VHS copy of Monty Python's Flying Circus? Is he reading the funnies in his local paper now? Because that's the only reason I could think of for him to pick Bran as King.I love every character who was thrown away for this unbelievably bad ending.Anyway,I cried yesterday when Bo Peep & Woody got separated in Toy Story 4.So why did I feel EMPTY when Danny died? Think about that. I didn't cry, I wasn't horrified, I wasn't happy, I didn't FEEL anything. No amount of emoting with your face or metaphorical chair melting (don't get me started on the fact that apparently Drogon understood the SYMBOLOGY of a chair with zero explanation in a 70+ hour show) could let me get behind this emotionally stunted writing. They expected me to empathize with someone who went full HITLER after mulling it over for like 60 seconds.Special effects are empty without the emotion needed to make them feel real, & actors alone don't have the opportunity to be fantastic characters when the PROFFESIONAL writers have failed them on every level.Final Verdict: -9 StarsHonestly by the end I felt just like Jon Snow in the middle of King's Landing.The confused, angry, and exhausted look on his face mirroring my own as we together examined the still-burning remains of the plot and thinking to ourselves,""WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?""",1,16 July 2019,22,31

132,"After a wild ride for 8 season the writers have decided to jump ship faster than Missendai disappearing out of a badly written episode. What is sad is that they could have given this historical television series a good send off, instead they barely adhere to the basics of screenwriting. To top it all off the constant fade outs bring the entire story for the episode to a strange fever dream that never actually ends. The dialogue is bleak and filled with half efforts that don't adhere to the overall theme of the episode. The fact that the writers also directed this proves their insolence and otherwise horrible background in filmmaking. Forgetting multiple points that happened in the previous 7 seasons and 5 episodes they forget points, beats, and character involvement with the scenery around them. What happened to the horse? How did Grey Worm beat Jon Snow to the throne? How in the hell did the lords roll over Jon for the throne either way? Or when Grey Worm left letting Jon do whatever he wanted?These two have only had this as their resume besides two episodes after, I think they should take a few more undergrad courses on creative writing before being given anything else.Sad to see a well developed world, characters, actors, set designers, cinematographers, costume and makeup designers, graphics, lighting, sound, props, I could keep going really.",1,12 June 2019,31,46

About the way danny was killed,the deserved a chance to rule but her moment of weakness was that she attached too much passion and personal life to the throne,a concoction of bad leadership.

At first I wanted to avoid spoilers, then I didn't see a point since show went further then books.People who say ""you don't like it because it didn't end the way you wanted!"", I laugh at you. I don't like it, because it's not GOT anymore. I failed to realize that show started going downhill long time ago, because I was in love with it, and we tend to forgive those we love. But Season 8... It's not GOT at all. It may look like one, but it has a soul of cheap sitcom/soap opera inside it.The GOT I loved could have ended in many ways: with White Walkers killing everybody, with Cersei keeping the throne and killing all characters we cared about, it could even end close to how this show ended. I would accept any ending, because GOT I used to love would tell me a Story of decisions and consequences, politics and intrigues, alliances and betrayal. A Story when everything made sense. But there is no sense in Season 8, not the way it's been written and presented to us...I was watching S8E1 and S8E2 with growing suspicious.S8E3 was painful and exhausting to watch, and that was the episode when something clicked: this show was never exceptionally smart about medieval warfare, but in this episode we were introduced to a whole new level of stupidity. Night King suddenly turned into regular B-movie villain who got killed in the most cliche way imaginable.S8E4 was the moment when I realized that I don't care anymore. I did not recognize the characters I used to love and hate. Faces were there, but characters were long gone.S8E5 was the first episode in the whole show I wanted to stop watching before it ended. I didn't and I managed to struggle through it. Thanks to that I knew exactly what I have to do with last episode...S8E6 was the only episode I didn't watch. Instead, I read its plot on the wiki few hours after it was aired, confirmed that it was worse than what I was afraid it was going to be, and now I'm going to pretend this whole mess of a season never happened.Now I'm reading books, and I will be waiting for a proper finale. Some may not believe it, but it's like winter: the last books are coming.In the meantime I'm going to create my own histories of Westeros while playing Game of Thrones mod of Crusader Kings II.

You all did an amazing job throughout the entire show. Even with absolutely horrible writing, you continually put forth quality at the highest level.Now, to D&D: I tried to think of an appropriate metaphor, and all I could come up with was a sports reference. The last season of GoT was similar to a Super Bowl game--let's imagine. It's the end of the last quarter and the prized team--D&D team--has to get a TD to win the game. The 1st string QB was hurt and can't play (George R.R. Martin), and the back up QB (D&D) has to get the TD to win the super bowl for his team. The back up QB runs the ball to the 1st yard line, turns around, and runs back to his own in-zone, where he proceeds to pull his pants down, urinate, and flip off his entire crowd of supporters. Loses the game....Again, this is the only metaphor I could think of that portrays the MASSIVE LET DOWN that is the final season of GoT. 'Let down' actually doesn't even come close to describing the tragedy of this horrendous season. D&D, you had it all. Universal acclaim, a dedicated audience, and a TV station that was willing to throw millions of dollars at you. GoT was the show that launched a thousand podcasts. Hundreds of forums dissecting every little detail that might inform how the final season would play out. Everyone was waiting with bated breath for the final season. And you robbed millions of that joy. Now, I understand that the source material had run out, and the ideas for stories was running very very low. But, guys, READ THE ROOM. Literally, go to any of the hundreds of fan pages of the show and just steal the best idea. Nobody would even know!!!! Even if you killed everyone and had the Night King win, it would have been better than the s*** that you decided to pull for the 8th season. There were so many wonderful opportunities for you to tie up loose ends in the final season, There were so many seeds (planted by you guys, mind you) that could have been explained in the final season. And you didn't do it.....Now, if I can think of a better plot for the final season, and I'm just a lowly fan, then why in the world could you all not put together a better story???? I mean, Daenerys is the big bad? Really?!? You spent SEASONS convincing the audience that she was a just and good ruler. Wtf?Honestly, I could probably write a whole book (or at least a decent novella) dissecting how horrible the last season of GoT was. But I'm just going to end my spiel with this critique: it comes down to laziness. You guys got fat and lazy, feasting on the fame and applause you received from your adaptation of GRRM's work. And I commend you for how well you adapted his work. But, when the material ran out you should have executed every resource at your disposal to make the final season a great one. And you didn't. Luckily, everyone hates you guys now and you will hopefully learn from your mistakes. Unfortunately, you leave millions of fans in your wake. There is a special place in the Seven Hells for you.

The moment they ran out of material from GRRM and the books and they it only slid quicker from there.The last 6 episodes should have been split into 3 seasons... that's how rushed it was and how much the pacing changes from seasons 1-6.

For instance, Brand enforces that he has no claim to anything, he says in s7e3, ""I can't be lord of winterfell, I can't be the lord of anything"".. and then.. the story goes out of script in s8..

The story was reduced to one battle scene after another, and, what little remained of the characters were hardly shown at all.Tyrian, my favorite character, changed from a warm, witty and intelligent man, to a brooding caricature of himself, constantly apologizing to Daenerys, and turning on his friends! Telling Daenerys that Varys was turning against her, knowing that he would be killed! That is something he would never have done!The ending was, sadly, rushed because it was costing too much to produce. And, maybe the cast was tired of playing their roles.For me, I rewatch the series up to a point. Then I stop, and will start, again. As for the ending, I don't care to ever watch season 8 again.

Considered by many as the best TV show ever, the writers messed up with the two last episodes in a rushed and senseless conclusion. The attitude of Daenerys Targaryen in the last episode burning down to ashes King´s Landing was the opposite the fans could expect from that character. But the attitude of Jon Snow toward the woman that loves him is senseless and absurd. The characters and the fans and even HBO deserved better writers. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""The Iron Throne""",3,21 May 2019,34,54
228,"Im equally annoyed at ppl blindly rated this 10 but more so those going out of their way to rate it 1 and complain about every detail. lets be clear this season with regards to pacing, dialogue and character development has been far from what we've come to expect from the show, but the worst episode is still as good if not better than 90%of whats on tv. Yes its flawed but the music and visuals aswell as the performances have been some of the best of all the seasons. This episode didnt end how i would have chosen, just as the long night and the bells episode didnt provide me with what id hoped.It did however close up all the characters plots and put on the throne a logical choice even if not the fan favourite. The show faced an impossible task in trying to continue to match George RR Martins high high standards of writing. People also have their own desired ending so they were inevitably going to leave many disappointed regardless of outcome. Would i have loved to see Dany liberate westeros without the genocide and take the throne?... ofcourse but it would also been too simple and what you've been told from season 1 is going to happen. I realky enjoyed all of Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklages performances and felt the first 20 minutes of the episode were the most enjoyable. Jon going north with Tormund and Ghost made sense and seemed right as did Arya sailing iff to see whats really west of Westeros. Theres alot to enjoy in the episode and in the season as a whole. its biggest downfall is time,a 10 episode arc would hsve made this season the season the fans, the cast and the show deserved. Ignore the haters and see it for what it is, a slightly dilluted version of the previously incredible high standards, but still an incredible achievement in all regards. The shot of drogins wings appearing from behind Danerys is everything and is worthy of the 8 rating alone. Its bittersweet but still sweet enough to satisfy.",8,20 May 2019,203,374
229,Man.... Game of Thrones was so good. Everything was just perfect and D&D decided to step in. How could they ruin a series like this. Everyone waited for like 1.5 years to get what? This? This is a joke.,1,2 January 2020,16,23
230,"Where to begin ...I can't. Let me just summarize.It seems that in a misguided effort to thwart EVERY fan theory out there, D&D discarded everything with ""meat"" that would have made for a passable ending. Instead, they went so far into left field, hoping that they could tug on heart strings with badly written death scenes, and long-winded dialogue-heavy appeals that did nothing more than make this fan wish I had not wished so fervently for this season.To say that the ending was awful, and nothing like what the beginning of this series teased us with, is an understatement.What was once a miraculous series that joined people of all walks of life in the enjoyment of ONE THING, is now a pile of ash bigger than King's Landing - and it is all due to the no-talent, brain-dead, useless duo of David Benioff and Dan Weiss, who proved conclusively that they cannot put together a grocery list unless it is given to them already penned, with sizes and amounts (Which is exactly what the books did). ___Disney, take note!!!I expected to cry, yes ... at the story lines and how they ended ... not at the futility of watching a ""10"" series"" crumble and burn down to a ""4"" in about six episodes.SO, to those who say: ""It wasn't that bad ..."", or anything similar, remember D&D CHOSE to end it early. They CHOSE to squeeze the ending into six episodes. They CHOSE all the ""not so bad parts"" .... AND If YOU'RE satisfied with their decisions and being served up MEDIOCRITY, eating it up and saying it was yummy, especially when you know they did better WITH a fully written script, then go on, continue to be satisfied with it. - - - As for me and the majority of people who dedicated almost a decade to what this show was, it was more than disrespectful to cast and fans, to end it all so ridiculously.",1,20 May 2019,182,334

From the awful writing from the ever so narcissistic and dumb D&D, who thought that they could write themselves a good script for this amazing show, to the most laughably stupid decisions and wasted character arcs - this season was the most disappointing and dissatisfying thing that ever happened. The first 6 seasons are superior - the 6th being my favorite. The 7th season was the beginning of the end of this tragedy that unfortunately happened to the most amazing show that ever existed. You could argue that the 7th season was not that bad and was actually okey, but it was not up to par with the previous 6 seasons. The last season for me, maybe had a few moments that I really loved and enjoyed. I didn't mind the first 2 episodes of the season but everything went crashing down in flames after that.

Even if I can make peace with Daenerys going crazy, being assassinated and Drogon melting the iron throne - which btw is an icon of the main 'good' story line of GAME OF THRONES! - all with no preps and developments, I still cannot understand the events in the final episode! So Tyrian who was, in fact, prisoner gets to suggest the next king, saying ""what unites people is a good story"". What a nonsense! How can you even come up with such nonsense! Actually Bran had the worst story line among all the main characters. Even if ""a good story"" is the only thing that unites people, it would not have been bran's!
Speaking of good story, I am not sure if GOT was the story of the magical mother of dragons or Aegon Targaryen with mysterious parentage fighting - and becoming - tyrants to earn the iron throne or story of useless Bran - I mean literally useless considering that he did nothing in The Long Night and The Bells - getting elected in the worst possible way to sit on on a wheel chair instead of iron throne and chase after Dany's Dragon! At very least he could have warned Daenerys of her madness or some how prevent Drogon from destroying King's Landing. Only then I might have given him some credits.

242,"One of the finest tv series of all time has ended, leaving us with a very sour note on how great the show could have been with its last season. Now I can see why George RR Martin said that the ending was bittersweet, it's because DnD decided to listen to him and follow his bullet points on how things should end, but they threw away all the logic, all character arcs and character development and all the major plotlines progression. All the setups have no payoff and are meaningless, they are setting up for 8 years the confrontation of the Night King and Jon Snow only for it to be thrown away, for a wow moment and the shock factor of Arya killing him, despite that she wasn't aware of his existence a few episodes before. They deprived us of a truly satisfying and rewarding conclusion to the Nights-Watch plotline that was being set up from the very beginning of the show, only to shock us for a few seconds with the michaelArya Jordan moment #YAASQUUEN (VOMIT WORTHY) ... They set up the confrontation of Arya and Cersei since season 1 only for it to be completely tossed away in the end, and having Cersei killed by some falling bricks in the hands of her lover, while they could have gone a little further to the left and be safe, as we see in the remains of the dungeon that Tyrion found them. What has Cersei done to deserve a happy and humane ending in the hands of Jamie? They rushed the Mad Queen Daenerys so bad, and NO people foreshadowing is not character development, we aren't angry with what happened but with the way that happened. It would take at least one full season for her descent into madness to be believable and somewhat reasonable, but they expect us to believe that she went spiral in one and a half episode...really?? Dany decides to help the realm and she is willing to risk everything for the cause against the whitewalkers, but merely 3 episodes later she goes on a rampage and burns the innocent people she chose to save by fighting on Winterfell?? It doesn't make sense. They made Bran the king while he's explicitly said that he was the three eyed raven and that he had no interest on the throne, only for him to say that it was his plan all along?? Really? HODOR HELD THE DOOR FOR THIS?? They also trashed Jamie's character arc, they made Tyrion a fool, they broke the lore by ignoring the prophecies, DnD read every fan theory that was out there and decided to make something that no one has guessed, in a fail attempt to prove their intellectual superiority to the world. Every actor is disappointed with the ending and there are plenty of videos on YouTube to showcase that. Where were the great shocks that we were promised and that would shock us more than the red wedding in the Rains of Castamere? Which battle made the Battle of the Bastaerds look like a theme park?? DnD were offered two full seasons with 10 episodes each by HBO and they decided it to wrap everything in 6 episodes, because they wanted to film the new Star Wars trilogy... SHAME SHAME SHAME!!! It's funny because they wanted to have a Breaking Bad type of ending where the only disagreement people would have, would be whether the ending was an A or an A+...well I guess that didn't go as planned. In my opinion it would be great if GoT had 2 more seasons after season 7, season 8 would be about the great war with the whitewalkers and season 9 about the remaining participants in the ""game of thrones"", in that way the story would have been given a proper room to blossom. I don't know what else to say, I'm just very sad and extremely disappointed, I guess they ruined one of the greatest series of all time and one show that could have been the finest of them all.

246,"I think modern day films and tv series set us up to think in a logical pattern and they often give the fans what they want and let them almost tell the story through what they want to happen.Game of Thrones has never been that right until the end. Naturally we all want the main hero, Jon, to sit on the Iron Throne but we were all denied that. Jon ends the story as the guy who didn't really get what he wanted or deserves yet all the other characters had massive gains from a crap situation from castles, to leadership to crowns. It was sad to route for someone from the very first season (other than Robb Stark) and be disappointed for them but that is what kept us gripped for 9 years. We had to accept Daenerys was going mad but we grew to love her too so it was also pulling on your heart strings to want her to succeed too.The only real problem I had with this episode was I wish there was more conflict in Jon when he killed Daenerys. I wanted him to break down and show that he didn't want to do it, but did for the greater good. I wanted more drama from it rather than a quick and stealthy stab in the chest. That is my only gripe for this episode.
My only real gripe for the season was the speed. I think more people would have accepted all the events and the storyline a lot better if at least one more season was made and all seasons from start to finish we're 10 episodes long.",8,21 May 2019,6,7

Please, no one expected Bran to be king. No one expected Jon to actually kill Draenerys. There's a bunch of open minded thoughts to be thoguht of after. The characters continue to live in the GOT world. They live on, Arya will explore Jon will be the true king of the north, Greyworm will protect Missandeis home. Etc. etc.Its a good ending to an amazing series. Looking at these reviews, one star rated with like two sentences written. Please. Just stop it, don't ever write a review again.The ending is acceptable, it could've gone out in better ways, sure. But nothing is perfect. The ending is worthy the series and that's it. Case closed. But bashing the series just because your little theory didn't come true? Don't call yourself a fan.",8,20 May 2019,6,7

251,"Clearly it was not the finale this series deserved, but a lot of people seem to be more angry than objective here.Were we very hyped about this season? We were. Was it dissapointing? Maybe. Was it CRAP? Not at all.Most of all agree that the problems were not the things that happen (for example, the idea of a mentally broken and desperate Dany is not bad at all), but the way and how everything happened (the breakdown was very rushed).Not good character development in this season, we are all on the same page here.On the other hand, the cinematography of this complete season is beautifull, the score is on point as well, art production is amazing, acting is pretty good, directing is quite good as well. The problem was not the production itself but the writing, and considering writters had to finish everything on 6 episodes, you kind of need to rush a bit. Of course, THIS DOES NOT JUSTIFY a mediocre -or not great- final product, but a lot of people seem to hate everyone involved and just rush to rate a 1 without apreciating the beautiful work we have seen. About the rushed writting, it probably was a budget issue, or maybe not, I really don't know.
The final product is clearly not great, but considering writing is not EVERYTHING (it is a HUGE part tho, we can debate about that), this is a very interesting episode, VERY well shot, pretty good directed, and it had a few memorable highlights as well.
I really suggest you rewatch it, and try to be as objetive as you possibly can, cause in my opinion a 1/10 seems to me like a complete effortless piece of garbage with NOTHING good in it. As I suggested, maybe you expected wat too much, we all did! but taking the hype aside, was it really Dragonball Evolution level?

It was the introduction of democracy.The starks are the ending scenes as it always should have been.

262,"1. Daenerys gave Grey Worm everything he ever has. Yet after he learned that Daenerys was betrayed by Jon, he did nothing to revenge. You may say it's because the north army has surrounded them and they want to survive. Excuse me, since when survival is more important than revenge for Grey Worm, a fearless and loyal worrier? And the Sansa can't possibly get the news so fast. There is more than enough time for Grey Worm to get revenge and then escape. And when those lords discusses the fate of Westero, as the head of unsullied, he doesn't have a say? He can just walk away with the fact that Jon is only exiled but not executed and Imp becomes the Hand?
2. Daenerys is way too mercy than she should be. If she was really a tyrant as the plot portrayed in the last two episode, she wouldn't have made so much sacrifice of her own men when defending against the undead. Her most loyal soldiers, unsullied and Dorthrakis, were at the forefront when marching to undead army. They were nearly destroyed. If I were her, knowing that the North dislikes me, I would ask them to form the front line and save my own army. And when she has determined that Jon Snow is her greatest threat, she still allows him to stand behind her, and have no guards when she faces Jon alone before the Iron Throne.

At it's best Game of Thrones was truly one of the all time greats, but this forever taints it's legacy. I just can't look at it the same, this trash season made so much that came before it seem meaningless. And it's no one's fault but the 2 clowns D&D. The cinematography, score, costumes, makeup, literally every other aspect of production was top shelf as always, but none of it matters if the writing is complete trash. I know everyone put their blood, sweat and tears into making this and they were doomed to fail from the start.It's so sad, 2 months later and it seems like it was just some crazy fever dream, like is that really how it ended?

Really disappointing to see your favorite character ruined by untalented writers in a single episode. At least give her a epic death, but she was murdered (like her father) by a person who was claimed to be Targaryen.
And Grey Worm and Unsullied just didn't kill Tyrion and Jon for no reason at all. She did everything for the Unsullied, and they failed to get her revenge.

If you think the writing is good, ""you haven't been paying attention.""If I were HBO, I would reshoot at least the last three episodes with more competent writers (or maybe after GRRM finished his books), so I wouldn't waste all those production money spent on the first seven seasons.

They had 2 years to come up with a good ending, they had money, resources and time yet they chose to wrap things up so quickly without much thought regarding whether it would even make sense or not.

Ser Bronn finally got his castle and Sam made his house proud as a Maester. Well, Dany as well got what she deserved, that Drogon scene broke my heart how sad it was. Bran being The King, its kinda what Three-eyed raven do, manipulates, and if you look back, thats all what he has done, with one purpose.

The show shouldn't have had this ending, the characters acted out of character, their whole personality changed out of the blue. I can believe Daenerys lost it, but for Jon to do what he did after a few words from Tyrion? After he was betrayed like that in season 5? Why ruin Jon after everything he's been through? That said, why ruin all of the remaining characters. It sure helps get over a show when you no longer care for the characters-they must have done it for us viewers. The system that was created is not much better than the monarchy-the nobles are gonna choose who suits them-the game of thrones did not end. Tyrion, whom I used to love, really didn't deserve to be the hand again since he ruined things for the one he served previously.

No delicious dialogue, no clever twist (I didn't say no twist) and no alchemy between the characters. There were touching moments: Tyrion discovering his siblings' bodies, Drogon's pain over Daenerys' death and Brienne's last gesture for Jaime. The rest was very inconsistent and boring from my standpoint. This episode used Tyrion's character to try (and mostly fail) to manipulate the audience about the writing choices. First, his speech to Jon where he explains how mad and cruel Daenerys has always been seemed like a bad justification for the choice to have her kill. Daenerys' character was far from being perfect but she had never, before this season, be ruthless without good reason. Then, his other speech during the trial when he claims stories are the most powerful weapon and that's why Bran Stark should be king also seemed like a cheap and manipulative way to make the audience accept this controversial choice.

She had 3 dragons at this time and Cersi was weaker. Why asking for a truce while you can end the war in one minute?!
The mistake her is that the writers wanted to make a twist and give one dragon to the night king. And can we do this?! By asking for a stupid proof to convince Cersi to accept the truce. And so dany and jon will go behind the wall and lose the dragon. Very stupid and illogical twist.2- Bran said when Tyrion asked him to be the king ""Why do you think I came back all this distance?""
So, Bran knew he will be the king and despite that he insisted to tell Jon that he is the rightful heir of the throne. Why? Because he wanted to make a problem between him and Dany and made her turn to a mad queen. This means Bran has a plan. This means he is evil. This means this is a stupid and illogical twist.You plant for a good twist from the beginning, but what happened is that they make a twist from nowhere then they explain it later. And the problem is that they change the characters to make it work. Tyrion and Jon and Dany became so stupid suddenly, just to make the twist works. You can't change you characters to make a twist. This is a cheap writingThere are many examples of bad and illogical twists in this season",1,26 May 2019,31,52

315,"After a long wait I was so excited for season 8 and it was really poor. With only 6 episodes this whole season felt rushed, but they had so much time!! Even more than previous years when they use to do 10 eps.This final episode in what should have been an epic conclusion and a celebration of a great show was instead a abysmal one. Characters acting completely out of character. The night king, a character who was so built up was just gone with a snap of a finger, a villain I thought would be huge in this final season.I don't know how it went so badly wrong... maybe the lack of source material but my honest opinion?

Despite losing all hope for this show after ""The long night"" and the following two laughable excuses for episodes this pile of absolute trash still managed to disappoint me.This piece of garbage dosen't just fail to make any kind of sense whatsoever, it is also so unbelievable boring that I was tempted to fast forward just to be done with it. Almost 1 hour of this 72 minutes long episode consists of the characters walking around and staring at stuff (or moving stupid chairs) and not uttering a single word. Although, when I think about it I actully prefer these long, boring moments of sillence to when the characters speak as they are forced to utter some of the most horrid and stupid dialogue that has ever been writen.The plot makes no sense and is a total joke. Bran becomes king and the North becomes indipendent with Sansa as Queen. Why would any of the southern lords be okey with this? Why dosen't they demand independence aswell?Jon exiled to the Nights Watch after he kills Dany. Why? Why dosen't the respawned dothraki and unsullied kill him? Why dose Greyworm just agree do Jon being exiled? Why do they go through with the exile after Greyworm leaves? Why do the Nights Watch still exist?Arya salis west for the sole reason that the writers wanted to ripoff a scene from The Return of the King.The acting was a clear 10/10 as allways but there is not much that can be done when the script is a total dumpster fire.A total disgrace by the writers and an insult to the fans of the show.

It's almost like the writers and directors forgot the ground work laid in earlier seasons. It was the laziest writing I think I've ever seen. They mailed this finale/ season in.

A teenage girl was going to be superman. This concept ruined the final season.Well, Tyrion's trial in this episode was a Game of Thrones parody. He was there to be punished but he kinda decided Bran to become king. Grey Worm's reactions were laughable.Then they rebuilt the small counsel and while people of King's Landing was devastated in the recent war, the new members of the counsil was talking about benefits of opening a new brothel.

Great ending nonetheless.I enjoyed the small council scene immensely, felt good to have some fun after everything. I felt very proud of characters like Davos, having made it all this way.Not sure where I stand on Bran being the king. All in all, not the worst choice they could have gone with?

333,"Every other season was completed within a year and the first 4 in particular were probably the best television ever created, better than Breaking Bad even.Fast forward to this season, and you have zero consistency, lazy writing, it's like the writers literally just cashed in and didn't care. How do you have 2 years to not come up with anything of actual relevance to everything the story had set up in prior seasons?So Arya wasted all that time learning how to fight blind, how to wear the faces of others just to.... kill the Frey's? She literally never wore another face ever again in the show. Sooo many missed opportunities for this character. And why oh WHY is she the one to kill the Night King? The writers claim it was to ""subvert expectations"" which is just such cheap cliche hollywood trash, the exact opposite reason we fell in love with this show. Arya had NOTHING to do with the story north of the wall, her entire story and countless hours of screentime developing foreshadowing was involved with exacting revenge on her ""list"", and she literally killed no one on the list other than Maryn Trant and Polliver, several seasons ago.What was the point of pointing out that there were all these valerian steel weapons? You had Jorah wielding heartsbane, Jaime and Brienne wielding the reforged Ice, Jon with Longclaw, and not a single one of them ever engaged a white walker?I just don't get it.... It's like they were purposely trying to just give a big ""F you"" to the fans that initially watched their show and promoted it to everyone singing its praises.The final episode wraps literally nothing up. Bran becomes king... WHY? We don't see any utilization of his warging or greensight in the final season, we don't really get much of anything from him really... and he makes a good leader why? He didn't even rule in Winterfell when given the choice, so why now is he suddenly open to ruling King's Landing and why is he a good choice?Why did they establish that the dothraki are somehow miraculously still alive and numerous despite episode 3... just to have them literally do nothing following their khaleesi being stabbed in cold blood? Why did they show a scene of grey worm seconds earlier slitting Lannister throats with no issue at all, yet he is fine just holding Jon and Tyrion prisoner instead of immediately killing them?Why does Grey Worm tell Tyrion he can't speak, then literally let him speak for the next 10 minutes and even choose the next leader for his people?Why why why why... so many questions and the only answer I can come up with is ""the writers don't care anymore""Such a sad ending to an otherwise great series.",2,22 May 2019,36,62

It all looked manufactured and faulty in logic, like the previous two episodes.Not even sure how to describe this nonsense, but long story short - Bran wins...on points. It's somewhat baffling how they get to that point, and even some familiar faces from the six kingdoms (yeah, you read that right) don't add any charm. Even here, the conversation makes no sense. After accepting Bran as Lord of the Andals, Sansa chucks in a diplomatic hand grenade, demanding independence for the north. Somehow, her claim is met with complete acquiescence by every other kingdom. In anything coming close to realism, every other kingdom would demand the same. Instead, everyone just wants to head to the pub.There's a bizarre moment when Sam presents Tyrion with a book called A Song of Fire and Ice (that sounds familiar). It would have been fun if the episode showed Sam starting to write it himself. Instead, some maister has already completed it, as though they don't want us to linger on it.The episode almost descended into parody when Tyrion describes Bran as 'the boy who survived...', leading me to think ""ah, so Harry Potter basically runs the show now"".Greyworm and the Unsullied just decide to sail off somewhere. Someone suggests they can form their own highborn house, but something tells me it will be limited to just one generation.Jon Snow buggers off to the north with the wildlings. It's not quite clear if his character was meant to do that, or whether Kit Harington finally had enough.That's about it. Boring, drawn out nothingness. GoT has had amazing episodes, thrilling and dramatic ones, and one or two that plodded rather than truly illuminated.

366,"Have you noticed that everyone around Jon in the last season was so cruel?
1) Sansa betrayed (she has forced Jon to be opposite to Dany) his own brother and become a king of independent north.
2) Tyrion brainwashed Jon to betrayed Dany and became right hand of king. Probably he was ""too close"" with Sansa.
3) Bran has told to Jon that he should tell his sisters about Targaryen's origin. Or at least made him to doubt that he can hide the truth. And he became a KING!
4) Arya has an influence on Jon and she also made him disagree with Dany.And no-one cares that without Dany they wouldn't have won the battle against undead. So the best gift for saving their lives was killing Dany in such a dirty way by her lover.
And if we look a little bit deeper, that in Dany's madness was Jon's fault as well. He didn't sleep with her, wasn't be open to her, he has told her also a lot of unnecessery words about his origin and family relationships between them. What she should have been thinking about it, if she wasn't used to believe in what people are saying, she hadn't any friends and the one of true friends died by protecting her from undead and the another one was executed by Cercei.
So my conclusion - Dany is a poor girl with a cruel fate, Jon is stupid and naive. And almost all the other people were garbage.P.S., what I've written above is not a compliment for scenario, it was illogical and stupid almost everywhere. The worst season, I think D&D should be get fired and in any circumstances they shouldn't be allowed to Star Wars.",1,26 May 2019,29,49
367,"I remember rooting for the starks from day 1 and I am actually happy about how the show ended with Jon being finally free and riding with the wildlings. I kind of laughed when they chose Bran as king, but that grew on me later on as it was the only way to achieve peace in the six kingdoms.
I just wish that they showed more conversation and reactions in the episode. The time jump from Dany's death to the dragon pit gathering disappointed me. I wanted to see the expression on everyone's face when they knew about Jon killing Dany. There was so much left untold and so many loose ends. I do wish there is a sequel in the making, not just prequels, maybe following Arya the explorer.
Apart from that, the episode was emotional. I cried a couple of times and I wished I could express my feelings like Drogon. The acting was excellent and the CGI, music, costumes and the settings were spot on. The episode had amazing frames and scenes. I loved seeing Drogon rise from the ashes. Oh, and Drogon's wings spreading behind Daenerys... genius! I loved that so much. I'm glad it was jon who killed Dany, and not Arya. Jon never deviated from his character and was righteous till the end, even when he killed her. On the other hand, Sansa becoming the queen in the north was absolutely well deserved. She defended her people and did what's right for them. She always sought council as a warden and that will make her a great queen.

379,"I thought S8E6 Game of Thrones 'The Iron Throne' was a suitable ending for the series because I never read the book and realized that the show would deviate from what George R.R. Martin may have intended as soon as the show surpassed where the book ended. Yes, the show was noted for many unusual deaths and sad injustices to major characters and hardcore fans expected similar surprises from the finale, but they did not get them.The power mad, if not completely mad, former heroine-turned-world-conqueror got her expected comeuppance from an unexpected character and the only shock there was that aforesaid character was not melted down along with the Iron Throne by dragon fire. His co-conspirator gets off much easier than he does, but after all doesn't he really belong in the North anyway? Tyrion's punishment is a prolonged stint of responsibility as Hand to the new King.Sansa doesn't become queen of the seven kingdoms but she does become queen of the now and formerly independent northern lands and that suits her well. Arya heads to unknown and far off lands and is the character I most envy in spite of her also having a relatively high body count on the show.Meanwhile Bronn, Brienne, Davos and Samwell, under Tyrion's Handship, settle down to the mundane business of running the six kingdoms with a completely unexpected yet wise new king. Grey Worm sails off into the sunset to settle the lands aforementioned by the counsel assembled immediately and strangely right after the sudden death of the dragon-riding demagogue. All in all I thought the ending was a nice conclusion and I even let a tear or two escape at the very end.",8,20 May 2019,224,452

Main characters becoming useless and practically turning into glorified extras. All the foreshadowing? Didn't mean anything.Don't even get me started on Daenerys Targaryen and absolute butchering of her entire character.I honestly wasn't expecting a happy ending because it's game of thrones, I always knew it was going to end sad but I didn't think it would end like this. It's not even sad.It's just utterly and completely disappointing.You won't catch me ever re-watching this show or even watching the spinoffs that's for sure.This big, iconic, beautiful, fantastic show started with a BANG and ended in a whimper.",1,27 May 2019,35,61

384,"1. Daenerys is completely out of character. She doesn't appear crazy, however magically lost all compassion and self guilt about killing innocent people. Her argument with Jon Snow didn't make any sense. Her point was that Cersei was using the city as her shield, but that wasn't true. They've surrendered and then she massacred all innocent people. Jon didn't bring this obvious fact when they were confronting each other.2. Jon obvious distress was apparent through the whole time, but yet was left alone with Daenerys alone. After she was betrayed by the hand of the queen and Varys in short period of time. What the? Yes Dragon was in front, but what about Arya which had to close ""green"" eyes as well could assassinate her in completely destroyed building with thousands of possible entrances.3. The biggest one yet... Jon Kills Dany, and then... SKIP of time. The unsullied and the Dothraki, SUPER loyal, killing kids, woman, surrendering soldiers without a care, but... the person who killed/betrayed their beloved leader??? Imprisoned. What the... They wanted to even kill Tyrion for much smaller crime as releasing his brother, but Jon is just a prisoner, LOL4.

Varys sends out pigeons saying he is the true heir to the throne, but that has nothing to do with the plot. Arya learns the ways of the Faceless Men. Sure she became an assassin and killed the NK, but she never uses her ability in S8. Bran's entire arc of becoming a 3 eyed raven to what? Attract attention to the NK and build a Targaryen wheelchair? Why is Bron the master of coin? IMHO, Bron had no business being there on the counsel. He should have died a season ago.

It was a chunk taken out to have character development. That development could have allowed more time to wrap up the story.Compliment time! The dialogue between Jon and Tyrion was amazing.

419,"I avoided writing anything about this series finale for months. I felt like I needed a lot of time to sit on it and reflect on it, as I wasn't sure how to feel about it when it aired. I originally defended the finale and told people that it was decent, albeit a little rushed. Several months later, and I'm finally sure of my thoughts enough to say that the ending is awful and very rushed.The writing was on the wall for this show when David & Dan arrived at the confusing conclusion that the last two seasons needed to be seven and six episodes long. By depriving viewers of seven additional hours of Game of Thrones, D&D pretty much guaranteed that the story that they needed to tell wouldn't have the time it needed to be fleshed out, fully make sense, or feel believable and true to the characters.Bronn essentially turning on the Lannister boys, both of whom he legitimately BEFRIENDED over the course of seven seasons, all for the sake of having Highgarden? It made no sense at all. Bronn was always shown to be the closest thing to a best friend that both Jaime and Tyrion could have had throughout the series, and while he is of course known to be greedy, the level of greed demonstrated in the final season was hopelessly out of character for him.Jaime running back to Cersei with his tail between his legs? I get what they were going for, and with more episodes to flesh out his decision to go back to her, it could have made sense. However we have Jaime pledge to fight for the North, and have several legitimately great scenes with Brienne, only for him to go back on all of it at the end of the very next episode, which is the episode prior to the one I am reviewing. I know that I elected to review the finale, but you just cannot touch upon these weird twists because they ALL hang over the final season like a weird cloud of muddled confusion.The biggest crime against this season is the turn of Daenerys. I was all for her going mad since it's in her blood, and I expected this show to ultimately end with Daenerys versus Jon for years, but the way in which the writers chose to handle Daenerys' fall from grace was extremely out of character, very rushed, and disrespectful towards all longtime fans of the show. She literally went from smiling, loving Daenerys to psychopathic ""BURN THEM ALL!"" madwoman in the span of sixty minutes. She bounced back fine from losing Viserion, so why did losing Rhaegal contribute to pushing her over the edge? Or was it just losing Missandei? Honestly, Daenerys still seemed pretty coherent up until she was beheaded. I don't think either of those two things happening was enough to justify her literally roasting an entire city of people and then going full on Emperor Palpatine on everyone after she was finished by establishing some sort of creepy ""you're with us or you're against us"" Targaryen empire. I'm glad that it was short-lived, much like her turn to madness. In theory, her fall from grace could have been extremely believable, but having her brain just go all screwy from the sound of the bells in King's Landing? That was half-assed and sloppy writing at best, and I can't believe that the script for this episode managed to get out of the writer's room.A lot of people I know were upset by Jon being sent back to The Wall. I was actually kind of okay with this, since I read between the lines and understood that this was Tyrion telling Jon that he was a free man now. What did Tormund always tell Jon? That he belonged beyond the wall with the wildlings, or free people. The last scene we saw in the series was Jon going to join them, reunited with both Ghost and Tormund. Jon never wanted to lead, or be a king of anything, so going to live with his loyal pup and best friend was a fitting conclusion to his story. Though it's sort of a poetic ending for Jon, I still would have preferred it if they had just given Grey Worm the middle finger, kicked him out of King's Landing, and told Jon to just do as he pleases (which would still ultimately be the same thing, going to live with the people he best relates to).""Bran the Broken"" becoming the new king was pretty stupid. Pretty sure Bran said not too long before the finale that he didn't want to rule, that he wasn't a Stark heir any longer, etc. Why the hell would they give the Seven Kingdoms to a teenaged boogeyman who spits out random bits of cryptic information in a monotone and robotic voice? Literally anyone would've been better. Tyrion. Davos. Sansa. Brienne. Anyone would've been better. You know who would have been the best choice though, and would have served as a nice little reset button on the story? Gendry Baratheon. Instead of putting some creepy crippled kid on the Iron Throne, why not put a Baratheon on it? You know, since they were sitting on it before the Lannisters usurped it from them? What right does a Stark have to the Iron Throne? It's all a load of nonsense, and it was really jarring how the decision to plant Bran on the Iron Throne was presented as pleasing fanservice during the episode, but I don't think anyone I know thought it was a good idea.Positive takeaways from the finale?1. Arya the explorer. What IS west of Westeros? I'm glad that they had her follow this path, as Arya has always been an adventurous free spirit. She stated way back in season one that she didn't want to be a lady, and she was true to her words in the end.2. Grey Worm leaves Westeros. THANK. GOD. Grey Worm was cool a few seasons ago, but he became really lame in the last season when he was Daenerys' blind follower. I swear Daenerys could murder Missandei with her bare hands and Grey Worm would still follow her. I get that he was all big on honour and loyalty and everything, but you have to draw the line somewhere. By following Daenerys down her path of madness, Grey Worm demonstrated that he was no better than her in the end. Good riddance Grey Worm, enjoy your vacation on the island of killer butterflies.3. Davos and Sam survived. Good. The story of Game of Thrones has always been brutally unforgiving to characters who possess good hearts and have only noble intentions, so it's nice that these two characters made it to the end despite the world being against them at times.4. At least Drogon survived? I think we all expected the series to end with the other two dragons being dead so this wasn't really a surprise, but the way in which Drogon departed was one of the few legitimately good scenes in the finale. Drogon roasting the Iron Throne, rather than Jon, after nudging Daenerys' corpse and realizing that his beloved ""mother"" was dead was actually pretty heartbreaking. I've personally always viewed the dragons as Daenerys' pets, and it really resonated with me as an animal lover and pet owner. I hate seeing animals outlive their owners, it makes them appear so alone and vulnerable. Poor Drogon. At least you made it to the end, buddy.This could have been a good ending had the writers taken their time, but D&D forcing them to try and cram as much material as they'd usually write for ten episodes into six hurt the show far more than it helped it. Truthfully, I don't think it helped it in any way at all. The last few episodes were just so rushed with rapid fire plot twists being thrown around at that there was just no way it could have felt like a proper send-off to the show. Honestly, the entire series finale, and half of the final season, were so out of touch with the show's overarching story that it was a massive slap in the face to fans everywhere. The ideas behind this final season were sound and could have been great with the proper pacing and writing, but the actual execution? Terrible.Just terrible. Because of my feelings for the final season, I'm removing my rating for Game of Thrones as a whole on IMDb. I had it rated as a 10 for so many years, but now I don't know how to feel, so I'm just removing the rating entirely and leaving the series as a whole unrated because it's just too polarizing now when you looking at the first few seasons and then at the final season (and parts of the second to last season).

Jon stabbing Dany both gut-wrenching and poetic. Drogon burning the throne but not Jon nicely done.
1 star for the second half. Trial scene a travesty. Why does nobody even mention Jon Snow's true heritage? He's just done everyone a favour and not even Sam or Davos have anything to say? Bran voted as King, whaaat? The one character who has done nothing this series. Felt hollow and unrewarding to the viewer just so writers could subvert our expectations. Dumb, and rushed to boot.
Most characters come out the other side ok - Tyrion completely unscathed by the entire process, Sansa makes her power grab a la Cersei, Arya leaves.
Jon Snow gets sent back to the North to spend his life feeling miserably guilty at killing his love. If anyone gets a bum deal, it's Jon. And for all the massive fuss over R+L=J, it came to nothing. Like, no point to it whatsoever. Jon goes back to the start, his entire character arc one big pointless venture. I wasn't looking for Disney but this was nihilistic.
D&D missed so many good opportunities with this series (don't tell me i wasn't paying attention - that's why the true fans have questions). So many ways they could have provided a satisfactory ending, but they rushed to a conclusion. In the end there were no heroes left to believe in. Nothing changed. The wheel kept on turning and the characters were all back to arguing over brothels. Bran couldn't even be arsed with being King. How sad.

437,"I feel like the people happy with this ending didn't even understand what Game of Thrones is about and that D&D wrote this ending for them.From the beginning of the show and the books we find ourselves in a fantastic but very realistic world. It is so because most characters are complex and have their own interests while every decision has a consequence. During the first seasons we hear about economics, arrangements between houses and war tactics. It was not only that it took surprising and devastating turns, they made sense, because in that realistic world in case of a conflict of interests the big fish eats the little one, or you could get stabbed in the back. Watching the characters, all of them, develop and move as chess pieces in that world was amazing.Since the show run out of books it has been quite different. Westeros is much simpler. Money is never an issue, debts with banks and other houses are forgotten, politics don't matter. We don't know how Cersei maintains herself in the throne, without a true claim. Great characters like Varys and Littlefinger became dull and didn't have any big plans whatsoever. Tyrion didn't have a good decision in ages, but somehow was still the hand of the queen as if she was forced to trust him and keep him as hand no matter what. Characters like them became a pack to other storylines as the plot reunited all of them and their goals together. Then, most of them just died.At the end nothing makes sense, it is an end yes, but it is just that. No real politics were discussed in the Tyrion ""trial"". There weren't any economical or power conflicts between the remaining houses, even after a war. It seemed like they just wanted the story to end. Why is Sansa the only one talking about independence and the rest of them have nothing to say? What are the plans to rebuild Westeros? The dothraki are not a problem? Is the winter gone already? Nothing matters anymore but to end the show.To close the story D&D forced every remaining character into an empty spot in the old structure or sent them away. And that's how they got such a stupid small council. Sam is the head of his house now and not even a real Master, what is he doing? Bron makes no sense, just the fact that they put him as ruler of Highgarden was so stupid, if you could be king of a rich kingdom that easily what was this whole show about. Not only that, he is the Master of Coin. And does Bran really need a Master of Whispers? The last scene of this council is them talking about brothels. It's sad, just sad.I was disappointed with this ending. It all felt empty of all meaning and I wanted to write my review here for the first time because I used to love the show so much.

442,"I have followed this TV Show for years, and to see how this show ended really diverted my expectations from a awesome conclusion or a heart breaking ending to just a lame, poor written, rushed ending.The writers ended our villains is the most anti-climatic way possible.. such as, the Night King getting killed by Arya with a knife trick in one stab.. Also the long anticipated ""Long Night"" lasted one night?, Cerci dying to a rock fall... and Daenerys just getting stabbed .. Why couldn't there have been a sword fight between the Night King and Jon? or Daenerys instead of going psycho, putting Cerci on trial and Drakaris her... or before Jon getting to Daenerys , maybe a swordfight between him and greyworm, to make it somewhat of a challenge..Again, it isn't that I wanted a happy ending... even if it was a sad, heartbreaking ending where all our loved characters get picked off, I just wanted strong writing to go along with the superb acting and cinematography.. So many plot holes, prophecies , and it just seems like a cheesy rushed happy ending for most of the main characters...F",1,21 May 2019,84,163
443,"This is one big embarrassment. A comical lighthearted ending? For the series acclaimed as an example of political realism?1. The episode clearly reveals the limits of actors portraying Jon Snow and Dany, especially in their final dialogue. Tommy Wiseau level of quality
2. The sequence with Tyrion entering the lower level of the Keep and conveniently finding Jamie's golden hand sticking out of the pile of rubble, and then the display his (not very convincing) grief, which we cannot share because we already saw Jaimie and his sister die
3. Arya as a courageous explorer is a shameless pandering to teenage and infantile audience.
4. The plug with the Song of Ice and Fire Book (wink, wink) is cringe-worthy
5. What makes these people think that elective monarchy is not a recipe for disaster? Look what happened to the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. And where does this council comes from, the cut to this scene was very abrupt.
6. So, the large mercenary army just goes away because .... ?
7. what exactly happened to breaking the wheel idea? we are back at the same old back-stabbing politics
8. Somehow it all feels a bit off. No sense of closure. No sense of ending.
9. Jon and Arya dialogue: ""you think Sansa will bend the knee?"" As if she has a choice! Look at what happens to people who oppose the dragon queen. How would you like to burn alive, Lady Sansa (aka ""smartest person I know"").
10. Jon is going where exactly? And why?
11. The cut from immense tragedy to the dumb comedy is really what makes this episode so jarring. What happened to the winter? How come they managed to rebuild the city and the Keep so quickly?

Im not even mad just disappointed
Everyone kept telling me to wait until the end and every bizarre choice would be worth it
But apparently it was all leading up to just a vanilla ending
So the white walkers and the night king were completely useless to the whole plot of the show they werent even a plot device to reduce danys army since she magically revives most of it the next episode and in episode 5 shows that she barely needed an army to begin with. So you can take out the white walkers out of the whole show and nothing major would change they were mainly to this show what the island was to lost just a mystery to hook viewers that they had no idea how to solve by the end so they solve it in the most rushed and unsatisfying way possible you could have taken them out of the story and gave that time you sacrificed for them to the whole mad queen plot that was horribly underdeveloppedNext up is dany going nuts well i still dont buy it they slightly fixed it in this episode by making her look like this deluded ideologue but still after 7 seasons of being a rational person she just flipped a switch and became mad, i mean if you wanna say it was foreshadowed that itll happen sure you can indicate that events like burning the witch the slavers and the tarllys were indications of her madness but i can point to other characters that did worse things like arya actually killing freys and baking them into pies to feed to there own father before commiting genocide on a whole family with poison i mean thats concrete proof of hannibal lector psychotic behavior but sure dany is the ""mad"" one . ""But the freys killed her family "" youll say well the witch killed danys husband the slavers and masters had slaves and crucified children and well the tarllys were enemies of war, would tywin lannister have kept them alive if he was in danys place ? Was he ever considered mad ? No just a brutal politician. And speaking of tywin was he considered mad when he orchestrated the red wedding that led to god knows how many people getting butchered at a wedding and ending with a wolfs head on a beheaded rob stark ? "" but she has mad genes "" mad genes dont just magically activate with a flip of a switch even the mad king became mad after years of decline. I mean i dont mind the idea of the mad queen but it felt forced rushed and shallow watch breaking bad and see how they change the supposed hero into a mad maniacal tyrant and then tell me danys turn was satisfying i dare you.And finaly jon is just dumb, throughout this whole season he was dumb (he just had to tell the truth because he is good old honest abe althought his own supposed father the most honorable man in all of westoros kept his secret for years and years but jon cant make it one day without holding it in because you know gotta be honest doyy) and in this episode he needed convincing that what his queen did was not right while using one of his two lines this entire season ""she muh queen"" im surprised he didnt tell her he was gonna stab her right before he did because you know you cant lie to someone youre about to kill jon thats just barbaric !The episode was fine i guess as fine as it can be with all that led up to it. Sansa's end was somewhat the most satisfying, we have democracy now so yey for that and the first democratic vote goes to a vegetable yey for that. I liked how tyrion stood up to dany showed us a bit of his old smart self before he became the incompetent sad tyrion of recent seasons. What else .. oh and arya becomes columbus.So basically the season was really good from a visual spectacle perspective (the shot of the steps to the destroyed red keep with the giant targaryen flag is gorgeous) but really bad from a storytelling perspective especially for a show that was considered the greatest show ever but the last episode was just fine with pretty shallow and unsatisfying endings. I didnt even have any theories before this season (im a casual fan and this is my first review on anything) i just expected them after 2 years to do something truly worthy to be called the finale of the best show ever but it was a let down. Woopdidoo2 days later : And to the people that are still defending this mess with there strawman arguments of you werent paying attention and youre just a hater and did you think this was supposed to be a happy ending or this is disney ? Well no i was paying attention and if i expected a happy ending i wouldnt have kept watching after neds head was chopped off and after the red wedding happened, two surprising and ""subverting expectations"" events that actually kept me hooked to the show and affected the overall storyline in a deep and meaningful way unlike the last season where subversion was for subversion sake. I couldve easily stopped watching after season 1 or 2 or 3 or any other season if i wanted a happy ending so no thats not why im disappointed. And to those that say to stop watching if you dont like it well i couldve after the first few seasons with all there non happy endings yet i didnt because they were good but after 9 years of investement you kinda wanna know where it leads to while hoping that even the bad episodes were leading to an actually satisfying ending. I was invested in it for almost 9 years and the writers knew that no one would stop watching because of that investment thats why they got lazy and greedy in the last season . Everyone agrees it was rushed and everyone agrees it couldve lasted 10 or more seasons except the writers who instead of passing on the show to other writers that wanted to work on it they just decided there ego cant handle it so they rush it just so they get to finish it and go on to star wars. The petitions may be ridiculous but at least it lets d&d know that they screwed up bad. No one is mad at anything else but the writing. And to those who use the other strawman argument of id like to see you do something better, what ? Everytime i wanna critisize a show am i supposed to make a whole other show just so i can voice my criticism of the previous show ? Or am i supposed to never criticise anything ever again and blindly settle on and praise anything that comes my way or else im a hater ? If you like this season i dont mind that but if you say that its the best way it couldve ended and that whoever is criticising it is just a hater and a crybaby well thats just not the case and youre just fooling yourself. You can go online and see so many fans that had so many better ways to end the series that are actually satisfying and true to the overall plotline with good payoff. And no this isnt disney the people that are using that argument as some clever response to legitimate criticism just fail to realise the irony in that response since the 8th and even 7th season is full of plot armour that you can only find in disney movies, plus the ending was a relatively happy ending with mostly all the good guys getting what they want so yeah you werent the ones paying attention. The whole 8th season just fell short of the good ending that a show like this deserved and no amount of quoting ramsay bolton is gonna change that.",1,20 May 2019,3,3
450,"It is altogether fitting that Game of Thrones, one of the most misogynistic television series ever produced, should limp to such an inglorious end on the first anniversary of the death of my Mother, a fiercely independent free spirit who imparted in me a life-long appreciation for the worth of strong women.One of the attractions of GoT was the introduction of women leaders capable of commanding the respect of their followers - until abandoned by the writers to reestablish male order, by salting their plots with gratuitous rapes and spurned affections to expose feminine frailties and induce irrational hysteria.A quivering Cersei collapsing into the arms of the lover she manipulated for years into unspeakable acts? A spurned Daenerys obliterating civilization for Jon of the fixed-troubled-expression, and then naively exposing herself to yet more domestic violence? A starry-eyed Ser Brienne padding the bio page of the all-male tome of the lover she could not hold? A bridge-year Arya, barely acknowledged for her singular role in saving all of humanity from the white hoards? Even fiercely loyal Grey Worm, also absent external plumbing, simplistically portrayed as an uncivilized villain in the end?Oh, please!And who were the alt role models GoT left standing to rebuild civilization? Sullen Bran and delicate Sansa, neither of whom ever actually accomplished much of anything, chosen by a pasty faced council no one much remembers.

The writing was terrible and there were scenes that just made me laugh. Episodes 1 and 2 were very good. Yes they were cheesy but they were mostly written well.

Also, why the last few moments may be tearjerkers, the character conclusions were either obvious or divisive.

474,The progression to this point in Danny's story arc went against everything that she has done. I like the idea of good turning evil my problem is that instead of how in former seasons characters all had their demises brought by their own flaws and mistakes but with Danny in the resent seasons the screenwriters gave her only lose lose situations and never allowed her the chance to win the outcome was not brought by believable mistakes that were made by the character but instead were brought only to service the plot of the shows. Whenever she listens to Tyrion and Varys they become fools that make her lose and when she ignores them and wins her battles she is a monster. They gave the character no option and claimed that former sadistic moments were foreshadowing but with every other character sadistic moments were triumphant for them like Arya for example when she fed Walker Frey his sons and killed him while smiling down at him she was arguably more sadistic than Danny ever was in that moment and for her it was a triumph for a character that would become a hero but for Danny it was foreshadowing insanity. I would have welcomed the mad queen subplot if the screenwriters gave her arc enough time to progress into that but instead 2 episodes after she sacrificed most of her army to save humanity as a whole she slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people even after they surrendered.

The dragon should have burned Jon to a crisp!! I disagreed that Jon had any rights to anything. Dany's character and motives were changed and the writers took the story into the BS arena. This was a major disappointment. The character called the Mountain had a sword stuck through his eye and out the back of his head and he kept on ""ticking"" just like a Timex watch. That scene reminded me of the Monty Pyton movie where the knight gets his arms and legs cut off and declares that ""he's not hurt-it's only a scratch.""

Bran does have limited emotions, but look what happened with Danny when her emotions got the best of her.I wanted more for Jon Snow, but I'm satisfied with his ending. He got to go back to the nights watch, the place where his character had his best moments. His reason for being resurrected was fulfilled. He truly got to ""break the wheel"" in an emotional heartbreaking scene that is true to GOT's past of shocking and morally ambiguous actions. Yes, his character isn't given any glory for his heroic actions in the show but isn't that the point?This show ended calmly, but what did you want, to be emotionally traumatized by one last surprise? The writers did that in episode 5 and all of the fans hated it. No ending could've satisfied people who came in with high expectations after having to wait two years for season 8.

So many mistakes and illogical scenes that show that they really weren't interested in fulfilling the stories that were set up in past seasons.

It was meant to be and they pulled the stupidest trick on the audience by pulling Arya out of a hat! I could go on and on but it makes my head ache!

481,"Episodes 1 - 5 are focused on preparing for the war with the white walkers, the fight, the recovery and then the trip to Kings Landing. Episode 5 ends with Daenerys arriving first to Kings Landing on the back of Drogon. She immediately goes after Cersei watching from the window. The dragon blows fire at the window as they are quickly closed by the Mountain as Cersei is pushed aside. Danny rides Drogon high into the sky. Episode 6 will conclude with the battle for the Iron Throne. Daenerys has not become the Mad Queen. Perhaps she was advised by John who received information Bran about the course of her actions, or maybe the storyline is not introduced all together. Regardless, Daenerys chooses wisely not to massacre all of Kings Landing. EPISODE 6 - The Game is Over: All characters have marched south to Kings Landing. The plan is discussed to dethrone Cersei and ring the bell to signify the war is over. Daenerys' army is nearly depleted, they won't easily when a prolonged fight on foot against Cersei's army. Danny does not want to destroy the city by waging war with her Dragon, she does however have no problem with destroying the Iron Fleet. She lights the ships on fire but loses Rhaegal in the process. Euron escapes. Distraught, Danny circles back around and lights the outskirts of the city on fire, destroying much of their aerial and preliminary defenses. This is the sign for her army to attack. Arya did not wait, however, and snuck into the city early to cross Cersei's name off her list. She is near the castle when she is apprehended by the Kingslayer, who rushed back to defend his sister. He takes her prisoner and continues his path back to Cersei to use Arya as a bargaining chip against Danny and John Snow, but before he can take Arya back to Cersie, they are stopped by Lady Brienne. Lady Brienne is sworn to protect House Stark and implores Jamie to let her go. He refuses. The sword fight ends with a pool a blood and the sound of metal hitting the ground, but we aren't sure who was the victor. John snow is now making his way closer to the castle to unseat Cersei, where he meets Euron Greyjoy who swam ashore after this fleet was destroyed. They battle. As the army is drawing closer, Cersei is convinced by Qyburn that she needs to leave the tower. She agrees and begins her escape with the Mountain but are stopped by the Hound. The exact fight from episode 5 ensues. Daenerys continues her aerial assault of the city's perimeter, her army is making progress, getting closer to the city center, John Snow has killed Euron and is continuing his quest for Cersei. Cersie, now alone, has found her brother Jamie, injured from his battle with Brienne. She is relieved. She will lose her throne and her city, but with her brother, she can live out the rest of her days with the love of her live and their unborn child. Arya pulls off the face of Jamie Lannister that she had been wearing since he was killed by Lady Brienne. ""This is for my brother Robb, my mother, Catelyn, and my father, Ned Stark."" Arya quickly kills Cersei by thrusting needle into her side as John Snow enters and a three eyes raven watches from the window. Bran stark tells Samwell Tarly to ring the bell. The war is over. The outskirts of the city is in shambles, men from both side lay dead in the street, Brienne of Tarth lays over the body of the former Kingslayer, Cersei and Euron are both dead as the bell rings and the Dragon roars. Daenerys is reunited with John Snow and the rest of her counsel and surviving role players in the throne room when Sansa reveals John Snows claim to the throne. There is shock and discussion, but then quite as Sansa notices that John is not saying anything. He is in pain. He is bleeding. It's as though he had been stabbed dozens of times, but no one is around. Bran's eyes turns white. He is returned to the night that John was betrayed by his own men and killed to be brought back to life by the Red Lady and the Lord of Light. John Snow dies as Bran reveals that his purposes for being brought back by the Lord of Light had be served and now his life retaken. Sansa is distraught, she vows to never bend to knee to Daenerys. She takes John's body north for burial. It seems the Game of Thrones will continue. For now, winter has passed and the first signs of spring are appearing as Arya is on the other side of the sea, Sansa is ruling the north, Tyrion is hand, Greyworm and Missandei are together, Samwell is Maester, and Daenerys sit on the iron throne, pregnant. The camera pans over the land, past King's Landing, Past the the North and the broken wall until we see an ancient ruin of ice and snow. It is a desolate place, but at its height exist a large temple where a flame once burned. The flame erupts into a blue fire. Bran Stark awakes from a trance. The Night King has been reborn, it may be centuries away, but Winter will come again. Black out.",4,21 May 2019,41,75

496,"Let me start by saying that I never had a single theory about the ending or a favourite character that I needed to see on the throne. I just wanted a conclusion that is drawn from from the premises that previous episodes layed out and for it to form a coherent ending. What I got was nowhere near it.And to people who say they liked it, usually I would say - everybody has a right to their opinion. But in this case, I just can't help the feeling that they just watched the show mindlessly, and just for the spectacle without engaging their brain.
I could go into details about why the whole season fell off, or even in details about this episode, but I'll try to summarize just the main resolution of it all and it's lack of inner logic.So, Jon Snow, the rightful heir to the throne, kills the queen. Up until this point, this was more than a legitimate way to become a king in Westeros, even for somebody without his lineage. But, now all of the sudden, it means nothing.He gets captured by the Grey Worm and the unsullied, which is a complete nonsense. From everything Grey Worm's character has shown us, he would attack and probably kill Jon as soon as he found out what happened, and not waited weeks holding him captive.Few weeks later, a council made mostly of Starks and their relatives, has a meeting in which they conclude, that in order to please Grey Worm who is a nobody to them and has no power whatsoever, they will exile Jon - their own family member, an heir to the throne and a person who saved thousands of people many times - to Castle Black, a place that has 0 reason to exist any more because the white walkers are dead, wildlings are not a thread and there is a huge chunk of wall missing.Grey Worm agrees to this only to later go away from Westeros??? Which defeats the whole purpose of ""punishing"" Jon.At no single moment does anybody even mention the fact that he is an heir to the throne, neither the people who know about it, nor anybody new who Varys has sent the letters about it. I'd like to remind you that his lineage was not only the reason that Varys was killed, and one of the reasons Dany became the Mad queen, but also that was the reason George RR Martin hired D&D, because they knew who his parents were years ago, that's how important Martin thought it was to the story!I could go on and on about the idiocy of choosing Bran the Useless, the whole character arcs destroyed and so on. But the truth is, the main plot of this episode made no sense neither by itself, nor as a conclusion of a series of these proportions. From the bottom of my heart I feel sorry for the cast and crew who did an amazing job only to have it ruined by D&D's horrible writing. We'll probably never get a second chance at this, and this is what we're left with. Shame.",1,22 May 2019,38,69
497,"Well this raring is not for the actors, or the crew.
What a shame, such bad ending to what was a great show. To be honest it's so rushed, from the way dany becoms mad and the way Jon was acting, it's a joke, Jon had 1 line whole s8
And it was, ""your my queen"" like come on...
Dany becomes the mad queen in like 1 and a half episode okei?? Forgetting the face That in s7 she was Learning how to act a good queen.
And the way the dragons died like, could They be more useless, except drogo OFC in the last episode killed everything, why didnt she just killed euron's fleet in episode 7? And how did he manage to hit 3 out of 3 on one dragon from what 1000m away and suddenly miss like 100shots on drogo?? And the way Jon kills dany, like okei u kinda see it comming but what a cheesy bad scene... nothing more to say.
Giving this a 1 star saddly,

509,"Nothing was left for interpretation - the viewers were treated as children watching a fairytale. Every cinematic trick in the book was used to make it perfectly clear to the viewer that Daenerys was the incarnation of evil, the only thing standing in the way for the world to become a good place. Every scene until she is stabbed is made to emphasise that this lady had to be killed - she is pure evil, end of story. She is easily killed by John Snow, our hero, and as soon as that is done the world does become a good place and the rest of the episode is a longlasting sentimental joy. The heroes won, the good side won - the world is in order again.If I was I child I would probably have loved this episode. Unfortunately I have watched all the 8 seasons leading to this point and I know that evil in Westeros is not away because Daenerys is dead. In fact for 76 episodes the evil in Westeros has been conducted by any other character than Daenerys. For 76 episodes Daenerys has been a rich character that for the most part has fighted for making Westeros a better place. Within the span of one episode the filmmakers changed her into a flat, evil, fairytale-character. If the epic end depended so much on Daenerys turning into this flat and pure evil, why did the makers then spend so much time emphasising how far she was willing to go to try to negotiate with Cersei and listen to her advisors?I would have liked an ending open for interpretation. Daenerys did not have the time to rule - we cannot know for certain that she would have destroyed Westeros. John Snow murdered her, a woman he loved. Is this justice? Was it really right of him to do it? Did he save the world? Does evil still exist in Westeros? If these questions were more open I would have liked the end better.",1,24 May 2019,34,61

It's as if someone was handed a 500 word handout of the story and was asked to write an ending for the show.I always regarded season 1-5/6 as masterpieces, one of the best TV-shows ever.

The Mad Queen arc was so poorly developed and Jon Snow - the most honorable man in the 7 Kingdoms kills his unarmed family member who is also a woman because Tyrion told him to. Okay. Sure. Jon and Dany were the only characters that had any consequences. Bran let all this happen - he's a king. Sansa betrays Jon's confidence and gets to be a queen, Tyrion commits treason and gets to be the Hand again. The writers try to explain it all away by telling us we just didn't see the signs - no - you didn't write the show with this end in mind and it's obvious. The plot for season 8 should just be a picture of Swiss cheese. Make sure there are a lot of holes. What an absolute disgrace to end an epic television show in this manner.

However, now that the show has come to a close, the season as a whole can be reviewed.This season started off strong: episode 1 was more or less well-received, and successfully set the scene for the coming episodes. It ended effectively with a scene of sheer horror, foreshadowing the arrival of the Night King at Winterfell.Episode 2 - to my, and everyone else's, surprise - seemed to be more of the same as episode 1. There was lots of dialogue and there were some very character-heavy moments. This is not a bad thing. If you rewatch previous Game of Thrones seasons - especially the earlier ones - they were largely dominated by such conversations. That being said, the specifics of episodes 1 and 2 unfold such that we are led to believe that we are seeing many of our beloved characters for the last time; indeed, in the ""Inside the Episode"", Dan & Dave (the showrunners) even alluded to this. The episode was beautifully done, but in retrospect I feel cheated (that feeling is, in essence, how I feel about the season overall).This is because in episode 3 (which, to be clear, is a phenomenal episode) all of the characters we believed we were seeing for the final time shrugged off death - literally, death - as if it was nothing. We were fooled several times during the episode and led to believe that our favourites were in real danger, when they were not. I don't think I'll be able to watch this episode again without screaming at the TV: ""YOU SHOULD BE DEAD!"". Grey Worm, Brienne, Jaime, Sam, Sam, Sam (that's not a typo - multiple by 50 and that's how many times Sam should've died that episode), and others.I do not take issue with Arya killing the Night King. I do, however, take issue with the uselessness of Bran (more on that later), and how quickly the Night King was defeated. I strongly believe that Jon and the NK should have had a duel, which resulted in Jon being defeated. Then, Arya killing the NK would have felt much more impactful, since we would have felt the true odds of the battle and the danger of him and his army in defeating Jon - given he has had the thickest plot armour for quite some time now.It also feels slightly underwhelming, in retrospect, that the one we were led to believe was the true threat and villain (the NK and his army) was dealt with so swiftly and easily. I know the purpose behind this was to demonstrate that the true threat to our characters has always been one another, but this makes the NK and his army feel like an empty threat (and not just in this season, but will be the case for all seasons when rewatching).Episode 4 also put me in the minority: I liked the episode. The only thing I could really criticise - in retrospect - is how effective the Scorpions (the big crossbow weapons) seemed against the dragons, yet how useless they were in the following episode.Episode 5 is another masterpiece - in isolation (pretty much anything Miguel Sapochnik touches turns to gold). I am still torn on Dany's decision, if you can even call it that. I do not believe Dany has it in her to rationally commit genocide. I do, however, believe that given all the loss which she had suffered in such a short time, and consequently how alone she must have been in that moment following so many betrayals, that she could have snapped. But from her scenes in the finale, it appears we are meant to believe that that indeed IS her rationality. This - to me - is unbelievable, as it is incongruous to her behaviour and personality which we have studied for over 7 seasons. To have this ""snap"" of Dany's character in so few episodes makes it feel incredibly rushed. I look forward to rewatching all seasons of the show (knowing how Dany ends up) and looking for more subtle clues in her development which point to this being inevitable.And finally, the finale: I've never felt so indifferent in all my life. George R. R. Martin wanted his story to have a bittersweet ending, yet this is almost entirely bitter. There's too much for me to go over, so I'll be sparing. I find it ridiculous that the Stark children apparently win the Westeros lottery: Bran becomes King of the 6 Kingdoms, Sansa becomes Queen in the North, Arya sails off into the sunset, and Jon's life is spared and he gets to live out the rest of his days in the place where he truly belongs. Sorry - what? This isn't right. Bran becoming King - after doing absolutely nothing ever since he fell out that damn window - feels so undeserved. He was useless for the entire season, and contributed nothing - yet he now rules the 6 Kingdoms? It doesn't sit right with me at all, and I can't accept it. Even though there were several scenes which I really liked in the finale and thought were perfect, the episode itself was far from it. I'm not sure what would have been the ""perfect"" ending, but this surely can't be it.I cannot complete this review without doing justice to one of the best characters on the show: Cersei Lannister. This season has been an insult to her: she did nothing but drink wine, look out a window, and cry. She deserves so much better (that being said, I do not take issue with the way she died).To be clear, above I have highlighted a lot of my complaints with the season; these are more or less my only complaints. I actually liked every episode except for the finale, and enjoy most of them in isolation. At the end of the day, this is still better than pretty much anything else on television (except for the finale).A final note: nobody seems to be paying attention to the fact that George R. R. Martin has co-produced this entire season. D&D are getting all the hate, despite George telling D&D the way his books will end, and overseeing this finale and them putting it together. He cannot escape criticism. Sorry, George, but you had better find a way to wrap your books up far better than this.All in all, this season has been an unfortunate way to end the best television series of all time. I wish HBO had pushed D&D harder, and demanded more seasons/episodes, so that this finale wouldn't have felt so rushed and unpolished.It appears Ramsay was right all along: ""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.""RIP Daenerys Targaryen; RIP Game of Thrones",5,20 May 2019,18,30

558,"There're so many wrong things about this season, but the ending was the biggest disappointment. I feel sorry for the people who worked so hard during the course of the last 7 seasons and this one too, because the show has amazing visual effects, photography direction, art direction, the people who made the costumes for everyone... I mean, there was a hell of work and effort put into this show, just for two people to make a bad writing and ruin what could've been the greatest series and series finale of history of television.I can't believe how sick I felt after the series finale.SPOILERS AHEADFirst thing that bothered me was the fact that characters like Jon and Daenerys felt like different people all the season. They acted differently, like Jon killing Danny for instance. He would never do that, is she has to die, why not letting Arya doing that? She wanted to leave west of Westeros anyway, but no, you make Jon (who has been shown as an honorable man the entire show) killing the person he loves. The worst part is that after doing so, his brother betrays him and exile the only character that united the kingdoms.Daenerys turning mad all of the sudden (Facepalm). Imagine Walter White becoming a bad guy from one episode to another, makes no sense at all. We know Daenerys could become mad but the way it was executed was a disaster.Bran becoming the king was a letdown. The character was not important at all in the whole series, (The guy doesn't even make an appearance during the entire season 5) but I guess you wanted to let everyone with open mouths after the finale. This finale makes me think like Bran is the villain of the whole show, someone who was manipulating everyone to his convenience. He tells Jon he's a Targaryen for the only purpose of creating a division between Jon and Danny, which later benefits him to become the king.Arya's role after killing the Night King is... nothing. It feels like the writers said: ""Let's make her killing the NK so it will not look like she did nothing this whole season"". She had more motives to kill Danny after seeing the suffering of the people of Kings Landing, but did nothing at all.Sansa is just a greedy character after all, who kept what she wanted even is she betrays her brother Jon in the process and does nothing the whole series. I was not expecting anything from this character but in episode 3 she seems very close to Tyrion, which in the end was worth for nothing.There're so many inconsistencies I could write for hours, I watched the show 2 times before season 8 with joy.

It was getting harder to ignore all the talk from my mates that Game of Thrones was the best thing on television, that by not tuning in, I was somehow depriving myself of one of the best stories to ever grace the small screen. I yielded. It was impossible not to get swept up in this world; a fantasy so sprawling and enriched in mythology with real characters you cared about. It was always a slow burn. A narrative always driven by its characters. Their choices, for good or bad, constantly changed the political landscape and brought you to new and unexpected places that was always grounded in logic. Brutal and unapologetic, but it never felt untrue to the world.Now here we are at the end and I wish I hadn't yielded. A budget of 15mill per episode can't buy you a good story(as this final season sadly proves). They've sacrificed all the elements that made Thrones the masterpiece it once was in a mad dash to wrap everything up. Characters are now subservient to contrived plot threads that make no sense, prophecies and family secrets that were so entrenched in the shows fabric go absolutely nowhere, you can't help but ask what was the point?

But taking that away, again, it wasn't a bad ending.The thing is, why there are so many inconsistencies in this season(8)? hell, why there are so many inconsistencies in this episode?
Everyone agreed to give all the power to their main rival house and they're happy about it. The House Greyjoy was fighting for their independence as a kingdom for like, 3-4 seasons (even more I suppose), and Yara does literally nothing when she has the chance to ask for the independence, wtf?Greyworm decided to take Jon Snow (THE GUY THAT KILLED HER QUEEN) as a prisoner (?????)I can keep talking about the incoherences about this episode, but is a waste of time.I'm not blaming the performance of the actors, is just bad writing.",2,23 May 2019,21,37

Not sure how Grey Worm was all of a sudden cool with allowing others to decide how the 7 Kingdoms would be run (including a large contingent of relatives of the person who just assassinated his queen). Bran's complete reversal on getting involved in politics was laughable. And the bit about Sansa insisting on having her own kingdom independent of her brother was ridiculous. Why wouldn't everyone else there (Dorne, Iron Islands, etc.) say - well, if his sister gets her own kingdom, then we want to be separate kingdoms too. Just so dumb.

When we have villians like Cersei, Joeffrey, Ramsy and over the time you make me hate them so hard to want to see them die, it feels so empty when in two episodes you want me to buy the fact that now I have to hate Daenery's madness, it doesn't, develope her madness, make me truly hate her, but the showrunners just make me feel pitty for her, the show runners only use the heritage of Jon just to make her a little more mad, that doesn't matter. It's the last seasson, time for us to have a closure: Jon had to kill the night king, Arya had to kill Cersei, I don't feel surprised by the changes, I have a sense to me like empty. Now lets crowned king a character that litteraly doesn't did nothing, Why Arya got that face change skills? Just to kill the Freys and that is it. When they killed Jon's dragon, I totally understand, they didn't have in mind to create a dance of dragon, Jon's importance just flush it away.

They thought they could pull this off without Martin also in season 8 (and 7). They were terribly wrong. This last episode (and for that matter most episodes since the middle of season 7) is a disgrace to the franchise and a slight to the viewers who appreciated the unparangoned combination of characters' depth, complexity and development, and the surprising but realistic plot twists. I have no problem with the events themselves, but with the storytelling. The screenplay was atrociously sloppy, rushed, and jarringly incongruent with the previous seasons, and the result feels, to the devote follower, like betrayal.

You having a laugh? Daenerys and Jon did so much throughout the series more than anyone else and helped so many people. And Daenerys dies and Jon is sent to the nights watch? Dan and Dave yous feeling okay? What an actual horrendous ending. You've made me dislike Jon Snow's character too for what he has done to Daenerys. He didn't even attempt to speak to her, just killed her while she was kissing him and basically begging for his love. So unlike him and just genuinely horrible ending for them both.

I could go on for ages about it but here's a selection:
The war 'tactics' was abysmal in episode 3 and it would have been so easy to let Arya have a walker mask when killing the NK that she would have removed after the killing. Low hanging fruit that D&D didn't think off.
The killing of Rhaegal. I mean - wtf?? And than the none-killing of Drogon when he slaughtered Iron Fleet, Golden Army and whole Kings Landing?
And how come the Imp just had to lift two rocks to find Jamie and Cersei? They could easily have moved 20 meters and lived when it crashed. And the end where Drogon and the Unsullied didn't kill Jon despite killing their queen and the cheesy dialog where Bran the Broken (WTF????) became king was so stupid. Just pure stupidity all over this season :(I am giving it 3 starts because of the acting, music and filming.Cult phrases like:

640,"*Spoiler alert*
The score was amazing and the cinematography was incredible. Plot was nonsense. Game of Thrones is known for prolonged conversations between characters explaining their motives but all of a sudden season 8 gave no answers.
There is no explanation given for anything at all. 1)There was no payoff to the fact that Jon Snow is a Targaryen.
2) They picked a king for the realm from a kingdom that's not part of the realm anymore?!?
3) Jon Snow was exiled because of Greyworm? Who later on left??? Why do we care about Greyworm since he is going regardless. Can't Jon come back as soon as Greyworm leaves? Sounds ridiculous
4) Bron is a master of coin? His qualifications are what exactly?
5) What is Jon snow doing? He wore the black but left with the wildlings? Why is that not explained? No clear answer
6) Bran has the best story? How? His story might be strange but in comparison to other characters it's the most boring.
7) they all agreed on Bran? When they agreed on Jon to be the king in the North that was believable so they are able to make a case for their decision so what happened?!?
8) Can't Bran find out what's west of Westeros?
9) why is Arya a faceless man again? She used the skill one time. 10) it is said on the show that the person that kills the khal of the dothraki becomes their new khal. Isn't that supposed to be Jon snow now?
The actors are coming out cussing that everyone should just shut up but we have spent money and time watching this show. We can have opinions. My opinion is that the finale was not good and riddled with plot holes.

After the death of the Night King, all the atmosphere was over, in the most anticlimatic way, with 3 episodes left to go. They decided to make 7 episodes in season 7 and 6 episodes in season 8, causing all the main characters arcs to be simplified and sometimes ruined. Jaimie kinda forgot that killed the Mad King for the life of the people, and all the time he spent with Brienne to go back to a abusive relationship and acting like it was a love story, ""Poor Jaimie and Cersei!"". Daenerys was always pending to tirany, but the progression to show her madness didn't convince many people. Bran or kinda forgot about not been able to have any titles or manipulated all the people around him, causing the death of those who stand in his way, but that is not something that is explored by the plot. Tyrion kinda forgot the smart way he acted while was in King's Landing, and betrayed Jon by not saying a word about he being a Targaryen in the reunion of the lords. Sansa and Arya kinda forgot they told Jon Snow he was family, and didn't move a finger to help him. Even looked like Catelyn Stark wrote that episode, giving all the Starks a happy ending and banishing Jon Snow to the Wall again, as a regicide and a traitor, with no name and no titles. He spent his all life to change the way he felt about being someone that no one carred about. Became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, King in The North, discovered he was the true heir to the throne, to go all the way back to the start, and now without the only thing that made him different, his honor.

Way to subvert me expectations...There's also a ""I am Spartacus"" moment in this, where all the characters agree to make Bran the king, and it's downright the most pathetic moment in Game of Thrones history.

Tyrian just somehow walks up all by himself and finds his brother and Cersei among a pile of bricks. In the previous episode the whole damn structure fell on top of them. But Tyrian walks up just like he knew they'd be there even though he was hoping they had escaped in a boat.2. Jon Snow kills the Mother of Dragons and the dragon just says, ""Oh, I get it now. I know you killed my mother and all but I see now that the iron throne should be destroyed. Never mind the fact that you just killed my mother and I'm the actual dragon that destroyed the whole city and killed all those people and everything. I'll fly off and repent all by myself now."" Seriously WTF3. Grey Worm and the Unsullied would have killed John and Tyrian the minute they found out who killed the queen but instead they decide to hold them prisoner even though in the scene just before that they show that he has no intent to take prisoners by killing Cersei's followers. Grey Worm was not known for his diplomacy, he was known for being a warrior unwavering in his devotion to his queen.4. Bran is chosen as king and Sansa says, ""No thanks, we want to be free"" and no one else stands up and says ""If they can be free, why can't we be free?"" Really...5. John goes back to the wall and Tormund Giantsbane sees him after expecting never to see him again and he is stoic and silent as they collect their things and ride off into the woods. He normally never shuts up but this time he doesn't say a word? Not even, ""Hi"" or ""Hey, what happened?""6. This one is minor but still annoying. Have you ever come home to a dog after being gone? They freak out jumping around excited like they just one the lottery or something.

They decided that everything will be super surprising if no logic or character development will be present.The dialogs were cringy, and the episode continues the atmosphere of Season 8, on the one hand it feels like everything is super rushed and on the other hand there are scenes of 5 to 10 minutes with 0 plot value time after time.It is easy to criticis D&D.

686,"After 8 seasons of buildup we get by far and away the most boring and useless character to be King. Words cannot describe how much I hate Bran - every time he opens his mouth I just want to tip him out of his stupid wheelchair. And people willingly elected this bland fool??? The bricks that crushed Cersei and Jaime had more personality than the three-eyed bore. A large portion of my life has been me growing up with this series and seeing it end like this just makes me sad. None of it makes any sense. Jon is exiled to the Wall to join the Nights watch - why does it even exist any more? The Night 'King' is dead and the white walkers are no longer a threat. Arya just leaves to go off sailing, which she has never mentioned in her entire life. What happened to the lone wolf dies but the pack survives? Bronn of all people is named Master of Coin? What? He didnt even realise loans existed until Tyrion explained it to him. The North is now independent but none of the other kingdoms even spoke up - this would create a complete meltdown of the Seven Kingdoms. What about Dorne or the Iron Islands? Default Done man #2 never utters a sound - he might as well be a mannequin for all I know. Edmure gets shut down for no real reason other than a cheap laugh at his expense - probably getting him to shutup for doing the only thing that makes any sense in this episode. The first council meeting with Bran the Erectile Dysfunctional just ends up with him leaving to try to find Drogon for no reason after a 1 minute of talk about brothels. This whole season just left me feeling totally empty and feeling resentful towards my once favourite show ever.",1,20 May 2019,44,88

691,"The show has been badly written since several years, with incoherent characterization (Jaime, Stannis...), nonsensical plotting (the Sansa-Bolton marriage, Sansa keeping silent about the Vale army, the wight hunt...) and juvenile dialogue (if I had ten dollars for every cock joke, I wouldn't need go to work tomorrow).Still, Game of Thrones has managed to fool most viewers and critics... until this last season. Strong production values, fine performances and an excellent score by Ramin Djawadi cannot save this rushed mess. I would actually be more forgiving if the show had a meager budget, mediocre visuals and workmanlike direction but solid scripts. Writing is the main pillar, everything else is just a (welcome) commodity.To be fair, this finale was marginally better than the trainwrecks of the last three episodes. It still wasn't good. It's like being mugged by a knife-wielding thug in a dark alley, then before leaving he just punches you in the face instead of stabbing you. Could have been even worse, but still, you are not going to remember the encounter fondly.Many fans are furious for Evil Daenerys, and I can understand that - it didn't exactly come out of nowhere, but it was simply too much, too fast for a character who had consistently been depicted as ruthless towards her enemies but protective towards innocents. Honestly, Jon taking down Mad Queen Dany isn't even my main issue. There is so much nonsense, such a lack of gravitas and intelligence, it feels like the world's most expensive fanfiction.Incidentally, even if he ends up on the Iron Throne, fans of Bran should be even more outraged: the character has been in these last years first a plot device to show flashbacks and then an emotionless robot who solves conflicts with his omniscience (Littlefinger's trial) and yet is strangely useless against the main threats (Cersei, the White Walkers). Now he gets to be king because he has ""the best story""... No he doesn't! Certainly not in the show.What a pity this once fine and acclaimed show goes out with a miserable whimper. First World problems, I know, but still. George R. R. Martin, you are our only hope... ah, who am I kidding. Benioff and Weiss will have butchered Star Wars before Martin finishes The Winds of Winter.4/10",4,20 May 2019,21,38
692,"This series finale unjustly treated all of its best characters, except for maybe one.After all of that, 10 years and 8 seasons following the epic stories and prophecies of Jon Snow and Danaerys Targaeryan, the series finale betrays them both by pretending that everything that came before for them was pointless, for the most part. They tried to salvage a meaning behind Dany's worth, but it wasn't sufficient enough.Bran doesn't even want to be king. Think about that. He made it abundantly clear. Sansa even reiterated it to him. What a great apathetic and ungrateful king he will make (sarcasm).The episode from a technical standpoint had poor pacing. It was very slow, downbeat, and scenes dragged on. Some early lines between characters felt forced.Again, all that epic journey Snow had come to rid of Dany, but after all that he is sentenced back to the Knight's Watch. They should have at least gone with that and found a way for him to take the throne, as was promised to him.The writers really copped out. Choosing Bran as the selected king turned the episode into a comedy. Maybe lightness was desired in the darkness, and maybe they wanted a somehow happy ending, but it can really be viewed as comical because it doesn't make any sense in coordination with all of the episodes that came before it. If that was their aim, they somewhat succeeded.This felt like a cliched, conventional way to end a long running tv series. They could have cemented Game of Thrones as either the number one series of all time, or at least an inarguable top 3, but by going the direction and with the ending they did, they leave it open to significant criticism, with plenty to be desired and many people let down. On a positive note, can't complain about what they did with Arya, that Tyrion lived, or that Jon lived.I would warn anyone who hasn't watched the series to stop after season 6, and only watch Episode 5 of Season 8 and the first 10 minutes of Episode 6 of season 8 and then end there. Danaerys won the throne, she walks out over her victory and the screen goes to black. Skip all of S7 and if you want you can view E3 of season 8 as a separate movie if you want, for what it's worth.",4,20 May 2019,21,38

Bran is the three-eye raven, and he's extremely important or whatever, why does he use his super-natural ability to help secure victory ? Instead they all sit there, useless and brain-dead.Moments like those are what made the fans and i hate this season so much, there were so many scenes that was made beautifully but the writing turn those scenes into garbage, the audience distracted by the whys and hows, can not enjoy the season at all.TLDR: garbage writing ruined it.",3,10 June 2019,7,10
702,"I can't come to give it a 1 because the only bad thing was the writing. The writing was very very bad, but the acting, the graphics and the set were still excellent. This last season did not do justice to the characters we've grown to love or hate. The scenes written for Tyrion were beneath him as a character and for the brilliant actor Peter Dinklage. Cersei the brilliantly played villain since the beginning deserved a better death than falling rocks. I could talk about many more but what's the point. Those of us who watched were disappointed in the final scripts; not because our favorites lived or died but because the writing and many character endings was simply poor.",5,27 May 2019,7,10

After that I hated Drogon burning the iron throne instead of burning Jon, because i didn't think the dragons could think so logically.Bran becoming the king was stupid and the whole scene felt like a bad comedy.The ending scene with Arya, Sansa and Jon was beautiful but it isn't enough to make this ending good.So, this ending episode was bad and I didn't like it but at least it had some okay parts and awesome music, camerawork and acting.",3,25 May 2019,7,10

706,"The beauty of the TV series was that it used the depth of the books to explain character, context and that I could, if I wanted, go deeper into the story and learn more about the past to explain the actions of some of the key players in the Game. George Martin made a massive error in handing it over to writers who turned up with big ego's and a big budget and had no hope of coming close to delivering the final chapters of this epic tale.It speaks volumes that the special effects and soundtrack are being applauded more than the script writing. My main problems with this episode, and the entire series, was that there was a devastatingly lack of dialogue. Where was the intricate storytelling through the words spoken by the characters?? In earlier series I had to pause, rewind, rewatch, read and take time to understand plot and every frame. every scene played an important part. In this series I found myself skipping and forwarding through boring drawn out slow motion scenes. For example. desperate for some kind of depth, the last episode left us dreaming up the symbolism of the white horse, when in fact it just was a horse, lost.My questions:How did Dany go from being shaken up, distraught and horrified on top of the dragon at the end of episode 5 to the composed, clean tidy and read for action Dany in this episode?Why did we not see the moments after Jon killed Dany? This was a huge problem in my opinion. Jon kills Dany straight to everyone together talking about the succession and Jon locked up wearing different clothes. No reaction from anyone, terrible terrible plot hole. No mention of Cersai and Jaime's demise, no mention of all the death of children, no worry about the dragon, how could anyone be sure Dany is dead considering the fact that Drogon took her, it would only be Jon's word and assumption. Lazy writing.George, please write the ending.",3,21 May 2019,7,10

708,"As someone who has enjoyed the show thoroughly over the past years, this episode was a tremendously disappointing end to a completely lackluster final season. We all loved this show, which is why it is doubly frustrating to see what D&D have done with it. Just when we thought the final season was bad enough they decided to subvert expectations and give us the worst ending I have seen in a while to a show. It's like they had an ending in mind and did not care how they would get from point A to B. Character development and story arcs are thrown down the drain. The ending feels completely unearned for everyone involved with little to no consequences for actions or justifications for decisions.I literally cannot comprehend the absolute abomination I have just witnessed- and all of it happening within an HOUR. Really? the fate of Westeros and the end of Daenerys' rule happened within an HOUR? What a joke. We didn't even have time to adjust to the ending of the battle before Jon has already driven his dagger into Dany's heart, and even quicker after that, without showing us the aftermath of this, D&D teleport us weeks into the future where everyone has apparently already moved on. And how convenient that the Unsullied and the Dothraki, both fiercely loyal to the queen, decide to do absolutely nothing and shrink away (less writing that way). Just like the Night King, Dany's is another arc tossed in the garbage in minutes with a completely unsatisfying resolution.The ending itself seems like it was written as a poor fan fiction, where the politics of Westeros are tossed aside, Jon walks away, Tyrion gets rewarded with another chance to fail as Hand, Bronn gets HIGHGARDEN (???) and everyone agrees to elect a boy in a wheelchair as King, a boy who has done nothing to prove his worth besides make clever quips all season long. The final shot of the small council with all of the fan favorites assembled together joking about brothels just drove home how cheap and corny this show has become.This was an incredible show, and the earlier seasons will always be great but this final season will loom like a black cloud over what could've been one of the greatest fantasy shows of all time.",2,20 May 2019,7,10

You have Dany, Jon and all these seasons worth of character build up. Years of character development, talks of destiny bringing back from the dead, surviving fires etc ultimately for those towers of characters developed like concrete to crumble like a house of cards, REALLY? It feels like they were tired making the show and just wanted to end it.If we're talking logic, we're to understand that the unsullied and the Dothraki (the violent barbarians) are totally ok with a peaceful ending where the guy who killed their leader just walks?? Seriously???BTW nobody watches a fantasy TV show to see people debating arriving at ""logical conclusion"" for something wars were fought for thousands of years. Just because its ""a"" logical ending doesn't mean its the only one. You made this about as interesting as politicians debating over the next annual budget.
Its hard to imagine even the actors were really on board with this. Sure on camera in shows they say that but privately I'm sure most would agree the ending is hollow.

That is what makes Martin so amazing. We know how many spots are on a banner mans flag, or what color Danys diareah was, but these two fade to black in almost every important scenario or leave the answers to your imagination.

1. Where is Drogon and what has he done with Dany...
2. So much talk about ""The Lord of Light"", no answer at all...
3. If Brann wanted all this... Why did he even tell Jon that he's a Targaryen.
4. Red Woman mentioned ""Green Eyes"" to Arya ... Dany nope, Cersei, nope...And loads of other questions...I seriously hope that this episodes rating stays at 2/3 stars...",1,20 May 2019,43,87

The secret about Jon's parentage they kept until season 7 finale was again a joke and merely served purpose to ruin daenerys character. Jon snow and Dany ended up being a big time losers. Especially revealing Jon's parentage was shown like a big thing and made no sense similarly winter is coming and white walkers didn't do much but gets defeated in the very first real encounter.

Shocks? No
Twists? None
Excitement? Nope
Plotholes? Plenty!
Unexplained loose ends? Everywhere.
Satisfying conclusion? Hell no.
Desperate rushed attempt to tie up characters stories? Yes.Bran being the three eyed raven you thought you'd get some big payoff? Nope nothing. The whole three eyed raven thing was seemingly a long pointless plot device just to back up Jon Snows claim to the throne he doesn't want, to get a new wheelchair design and to fly around aimlessly as a raven.Jon Snow being Aegon Targaryen was literally pointless it literally went nowhere. A complete waste of a good character arc. Might as well have not even given him that back story as it had such little effect on the ending.The entire last episode seemed rushed and hashed together. Most of the episode was people sat around talking. You spend the whole time waiting for something to happen waiting for some big surprise or shock but all you get is more talking.The throne being decided by a vote who seriously thought that was a satisfying ending? After all this time and this entire epic story the throne is decided by a vote? I mean wow.Who was the lord of light? Guess we will never know as it's never been mentioned since the night king battle. Just another loose end never explained.The entire ending felt forced and left me with an empty feeling.It feels like we've been on an epic rollercoaster ride and just as we're about to get to the big loop the loop at the end the most exciting bit the ride breaks down and we're forced to jump off to never get that final thrill.",1,20 May 2019,50,103

A story of such magnitude & complexity requires seasons to reach its ending. Just look at breaking bad for example, they even had extra episodes in its last season to wrap it up in a nice and delicate way. The laziness in the plot and the writing is below amature level, they ignore everything and just force everything to their desired ending. The show should have had 10 seasons probably with a slow and delicate pacing, giving each character the time he needs to end his arc.

Some of their actions did make sense to me, however this finale episode made it really hard to defend the season. I thought it would wrap up in a much more satisfying way to make sense of all the prior episodes. Maybe I gave the writers too much credit.I feel like I have the most to say about Dany, not because she's my favorite character but because they really did not do her character justice. I had no problem with Dany becoming a ""Mad Queen,"" but the progression did feel very rushed and sudden. I don't quite believe that loss would suddenly cause you to want to wreak havoc on innocent screaming civilians. This should have been spread out more or given more palatable ways for us to see her decent into madness. I do get she is a Targ, suffered so much loss, lost the faith/trust/love of Jon & her advisers, and son on, so it's not COMPLETELY left field but it still did not feel like a natural progression. Her death was SO anticlimactic that it almost felt like she wasn't even a significant character. She didn't even say anything, just .... died. Jamie got stabbed, twice?, and managed to make it to Cersei and have a beautiful ending together. Dany's was just, anticlimactic as hell.How the rest of the main characters were handled, it wasn't that satisfying but I'm not that mad at it. It's anticlimactic but oh well I guess. They all stayed pretty on brand, it's just Dany that didn't really make sense to me.I can't give it 1 stars. The cast, visuals, music, etc don't deserve that rating. They did incredible.

How was he arrested, wouldn't he be killed immediately in anger?Where's all John's men, weren't they around for the battle?Where's the white horse gone?

A show that used to be so rich and complex is given a conclusion that has less than twenty minutes of dialogue; and what is there features such gems as Arya knowing a killer when she sees one. The ending is so bad I don't think I can watch Thrones ever again. There are so many plotholes, abandoned/useless storylines, ruined characters, and totally inexplicable plot developments that there appears a strong contempt for the intelligence of the audience.

Scenes were so forced with actors trying their best when you can tell they hated filming these ridiculous scenes.I feel crushed to see what they did to Dany and Jon, both deserved so so so much better.

The queen who we spent 70+ hours following her journey from a belittled non-entity to the beloved breaker of chains, turned heel largely over the course of 160 minutes and is then put down. The underdog of the series who becomes a true hero through his honorable actions then rides off into the middle of nowhere which in his mind may be a sort of freedom but to the audience it is far from any sort of glory.Such a great example of wasted potential and it really missed the mark of wrapping up one of the best (unfinished) book to tv series of all time.My review is 4 stars because the cast did a phenomenal job acting with what they were given and it must be noted. The fact that the writing was so rushed and poorly executed this season just continually pulled me out of the experience that was Game of Thrones, and this finale was undoubtedly the final nail in the coffin.",4,20 May 2019,32,63

871,I have religiously watched GOT from the beginning and loved it until now. This last season has been rushed and trying to cram everything into 6 episodes has made it a great disappointment to watch. Seeing Jon Snow grow into a great character as well as Danny through 7 seasons has been great but then to see season 8 (in great anticipation) has been the biggest disappointment in a tv series I have ever watched.,1,21 May 2019,13,22
872,"I am stuck with a feeling that nothing mattered in the end.There is so much wrong here. Time and time again those I was watching with had the ""Is this for real?"" feeling of that we were watching a parody.Here are a few examples:Why do they need a Wall and Nights Watch when the White Walkers are gone, and the people north of the wall are now friends?Why is everyone so calm and peaceful all of a sudden. Have every person with ambitions to power been killed? Everyone suddenly listens to calm compromises. It seems very unrealistic in light of the last 72 (!) episodes of violence and multi polar structures of authority. At these moments in history, vassals tend to break free - just like Sansa does, but the others just sit there happy to crown a random dude to rule over them fore life, instead of saying ""Know what? I think I'll leave, and be my own King"".Since the Unsullied were the only ones with actual land armies who wanted Jon punished, and they left - why didn't just Jon walk away? Sansa would never have stopped with ""Oh, but those Unsullied on the other side of the ocean will come back and beat us up if I don't abide by what they told us before. Sorry Jon!"". And without the Unsullied, it would seem that the Greyjoys are alone against the entire world - so, not really a problem at all.Also, Greyworm would absolutely have killed Jon on the spot if he realized he had killed Daenerys (whom Greyworm loved platonically). It is insane to think he would have reacted with: ""What's that, he killed my queen? Well of course he needs a fair trial! Because that's what we are all about! Fair trials and correct jurisdiction. We don't just kill people on the spot! Also, it's not like I had some deep emotional bond with my now murdered queen. At least nothing that trumps my deep love and respect for proper judicial conduct.""Regarding the ending, and Bran as king - the only three words that matter saying are: Deus Ex Machina. It's a total case of deus ex machina. Sure, there was buildup and foreshadowing for Bran doing something important - but NOT for him becoming King. That's as if Gollum's foreshadowing would lead him to become the King of Gondor. And the entire biggest twists of the show; Jon coming back, AND Jon proving to be Aegon Targaryen - eventually were completely meaningless (""Haha! You thought the biggest revelations held any weight at all? Sucker!""). Because you know, in the world of Game of Thrones - names and titles and such doesn't matter at all. Only calm reasoning and rule of law does.Which brings me to the argument for Bran being a good candidate; his supposedly great story: (1) getting broken, (2) traveling to the Arctic, (3) the only truly important thing: becoming the Three Eyed Raven. Virtually nobody in this world knows what the Three Eyed Raven is, so that's as if a US Presidential candidate would run on the slogan: ""I became the One Eared Fox when I travelled to Greenland. That's why I am your guy!"". Nobody knows what that means.In the eyes of the people of Westeros, Bran has a story without any relevance at all. Whereas Jon has a truly awe inspiring one. He came back from the dead for his people. He defeated the Boltons. He killed the Mad Queen. Oh, and he is Aegon Targaryen. And he is likable, calm and rational (which Bran also is) - BUT, he is also strong and inspiring (which Bran certainly has never been to anyone besides Hodor and company).In the end, making Bran king had one reason alone: SHOCK VALUE. That's all. Spectacle. Ironically, the same criticism Arya gave that horribly bad theatre in Bravos, I give the show: There is great potential in the actor(s) here, but the writer of the script squanders it on shock value.Also, a small detail, but still: A good king wouldn't let Bronn get EVERYTHING he threatened with murder to get. That's not a good start of a new reign, to let a cynical crook into your Government.And why does Bran immediately leave his first Government meeting ever, to go fly around after Drogon? If it was so very important, he surely would have done it before the meeting.Though: Brienne's scene with her saying Goodbye to Jamie by writing about him. was beautiful. And the scene where Jon and Daenerys last spoke was also quite well made.But all in all, It was the worst show ending I have seen in my entire life. It truly feels like a parody of what it once was.As the last scene fades to black, I am stuck with this feeling that all 73 Game of Thrones episodes actually meant nada in the end.In regards to Sophie Turner calling it ""disrespectful"" to say the last season is very bad. Yes, it is disrespectful to offer one's honest opinion, at least if we ask Daenerys and Cersei. They hate pluralism. But not if we ask Sam, Bran and Jon. It is disrespectful to be disrespectful. It is disrespectful to say hateful and unwarranted things towards individuals. And I for one, happen to think Sophie Turner and the rest of the cast are BRILLIANT at acting. They are the ones who have given us the few moments of greatness this last season (i.e. sometimes saved us from the writing). But saying a work of art is bad (in this case the writing), that is not disrespectful. It is partaking in pluralism and voicing one's honest and truthful opinion - calmly, rationally and without hate.",1,21 May 2019,13,22
873,"I've watched the show since it debuted, I've read the books. This final season is a letdown. Sure I can see some of the arcs for certain characters being similar once GRRM finishes the books but how this final season (and season 7 really) paced the plots was awful. I've get credit to those who worked on the special effects and the costume designers and lol the rest for putting in so much hard work, but it doesn't stop this season from being so disappointing. A coffee cup in episode 4 a water bottle in episode 6. The writers contradicting character decisions in the after the episode, poorly lit and overly plot armored episode 3, it was all just so bad after waiting 2 years for this. The writing after season 6 really, got so chaotic it's hard not to wonder if D&D can write more than one season without book material. I can only hope GRRM cleans the narrative up with his final books. Honestly though, no pressure considering I think almost anything would be better than season 8, aside from a few good moments to start the season.",1,21 May 2019,13,22

Many Targaryens have died to dragons, Stannis himself mentions Queen Rhaenyra being burnt then eaten by a dragon at Dragonstone. If you don't want to kill off Jon then don't put him in a position where he should have died. That scene did not only literally kill Daenerys but it killed Drogon too. Similarly why didn't Greyworm just instantly kill Jon for killing Dany? Just makes no sense. STOP PUTTING CHARACTERS IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN SURVIVE IS WITH ILLOGICAL REASONS.King Bran, ah yes maybe it will have the build up in the books but this has been extremely unsatisfying. Why is he more qualified to be King than any of the other people. Unless Bran has been manipulating things to happen so he can end up King but they didn't even imply it.Bronn on the council! HAHA, very fan fictiony he will make the crown bankrupt in a few weeks.Sam who was in the citadel for a few weeks is now the Grand Maester? There goes years of training and chains, as far as I am aware the war on the show did not reach Oldtown so there are clearly more qualified individuals than him for the job.Why is there a Night's Watch now? The Others are gone forever and the Wildlings have made peace with the North.

We were told the reasons she burned the city alive but it didn't feel genuine since she hadn't burned innocents before.

914,"I watched this right from the beginning and went along with all the story scenarios and outcomes until the last series. Every episode of s8 was was brilliant apart from the most important thing, the story telling and the final outcome. Music, sound, special effects, acting, camera work, atmosphere were all 7 out of 10 or higher. I feel sorry for the cast and everyone else who worked so hard for so long. It's like the writers got bored and had something better to go and work on. Surely there could have been a couple of inbetween episodes where they could've shown the journeys people had to take to get to Winterfell and kings Landing tying up some other character loose ends on the way. Everyone just seemed to turn up. The death of Jamie and Cersie was pathetic. Brianne writing in the book was nice albeit using incredibly fast drying ink! Some bits were done very well, other bits okay, some rubbish. Was this season proof watched? Maybe not ( take away coffee anyone)? I know it was always going to be hard to please everyone. Even so given the budget, the time they had to make it and the fact we had so long to get to know the characters, this in my opinion has fallen well short of the WRITING expectations we have grown used to. Surely some of the actors could've spoken up especially knowing their own characters so well. I can't see many people watching reruns or buying the dvd or bluray discs etc, not now, knowing what happens. After watching the last episode It feels like a massive let down. There are a few questions fans want answering involving some of the chracters from past seasons and episodes.... like where did the dragon go. Makes me wonder if it's a publicity stunt to sell more books when they're finished! Even though Danny went mad it still could've ended better, maybe she could've had an overwhelming feeling of guilt, ordered her own death, had greyworm do it and ordered John to be king, John could've still gone north if he didn't want the throne. The whole choosing of the king was poorly done as was the first small council meeting. Bran said why do you think i came all this way.... I beginning to ask, why did we? So in the end Bran was as bad as the rest of them letting it all unfold just so he could get there himself? Sorry to waffle on.",3,26 May 2019,11,18

919,"Poor argument, poor characters development and poor final scene!
Not worth the other seven seasons.",2,21 May 2019,11,18
920,"There are so many problems with this finale, and I am not even talking about technicalities, literal plot issues but nonetheless let's start with the few good things that happened in this episode:1. Jon petting Ghost at last and the scene being shot in the same way as the one shot earlier (season 4, perhaps?)2. Arya's arc was well written. She's the one character that didn't encounter a fatal error with her arc as almost everyone else did. And again it was a callback to season 4 finale. I hope she discovers the mystery lying to the West of Westeros.3. The biggest win in this episode was the metaphor of Sansa's hair. She has always copied the hairstyle of more powerful women who have influenced her life from Catelyn to Cersei to Margery to Daenerys but she finally got a new hairstyle showing that she's come into her own at last. I'm glad somebody on the team reminded D&D of it.Now let's come to the bad, oh it's gonna be long-1. What was Dany's justification of committing the mass murder? She refuses to respond to Tyrion's question and when Jon asks the same question she says Cersei used the innocents to cripple her? Where? Had she gone deaf when the city surrendered and the bells rang? We still have no real reason why she committed the genocide cause she was clearly not clinically mentally ill.2. Where did the ""others don't get to choose"" Dany suddenly come from? It literally feels like after S08E03 we skipped two seasons and directly jumped to S08E05. The Dany who was not to be the Queen of Ashes became so for no reason. The Dany who always controlled her impulses and chose the mellow path suddenly became violent for no reason. The Dany who always took others' inputs and gave people multiple chances suddenly became adamant and dictatorial.3. Jon killed Dany? I have never laughed at a scene this hard. I know why they went for such a romanticized direction of that scene (it was supposed to be a callback to season 4 Ygritte's death scene again. Too many callbacks? I know!) but how did he suddenly kill her? Yes Tyrion put the thought in his head but Dany had just given the ""build the world with me"" pep talk. He had no reason to think she'd kill him after all she was willing to marry him and break the wheel together despite him having a better claim to the throne. Tyrion's pep talk had been proven wrong!4. Drogon comes screaming into the room and burns the throne out of angst but doesn't kill Jon, the murderer of his mother? Were the writers on crack when they wrote this episode?5. Jon tries to justify Dany's mass murder to Tyrion with ""put yourself in her shoes"". Is this the same Jon who fought for the living by putting himself at risk? Is this the same Jon who saw his family massacred but stuck by his duty? The man who fought his brothers of the Night's Watch and died for saving the lives of innocent Wildlings?6. What was the point of Tyrion's sarcastic ""she murders evil men"" pep talk? Everywhere Dany went she killed evil men because they were *evil men*. Is Tyrion trying to justify the acts of slavers or the Dothraki Khals or Viserys? Is he trying to say Dany has become too powerful to see right from wrong even though 2 episodes ago she fought the Army of the Dead risking her army, dragons and her own life? So all of a sudden her sense of decision making became clouded? Very convenient? **slow claps**7. Tyrion confessing he was in love with Dany, even though the only sign he showed was a slightly incredulous expression at the end of season 7 when Dany and Jon were doing it on the boat, was for whom exactly? It made us all cringe.8. What was the point of bringing Arya to King's Landing in the last episode (while making the fatal attempt of ruining her character arc along with everybody else's) and then having her escape out of *fear of death* and then having her come back to King's Landing again in this episode and doing absolutely nothing *AGAIN*?9. What was the point of the scene where Dany makes the grand entry and the camera work shows her as a dragon with wings? Was it supposed to imply that all dragons are bad? Is that why Jon was pushed as a good guy? Is that why Drogon didn't go on a mass murder throughout Westeros while lamenting his mother's death? Oh wait...10. Lastly (because I don't have all day to list every damn problem with this episode), the worst thing the writers could've done was make Bran the King and actually have Lords vote for him!!! First off why is no one questioning why he didn't warn everyone about Dany burning King's Landing beforehand when he clearly had visions of that in S04E02 and S06E06? It's not like no one knows he can see the future. He literally says to Tyrion ""Why do you think I came all this way?"" and had said earlier (in S08E01) that he is ""waiting for an old friend) while expecting Jaime to arrive. Why did no one ask his help in making strategies for the attack on King's Landing? The writers seem so desperate to get from the good-Dany to bad-Dany arc that they completely stripped the writing of all sense to force her to break bad within one episode.The most tragic thing about this season is that it was the most hyped one of all time and more people were watching than ever before (about 1 Billion according to some estimate). The way it has disappointed, it has set another record for this show. This time for being the worst season and the worst series Finale for any series ever!",2,20 May 2019,11,18
921,"My goodness this episode was absolute rubbish. Not only the worst episode of the series, or the worst finale in TV history. Perhaps one of the worst episodes of any show I have seen in my life considering how good it could have been. Awful writing and filled with plot holes. Seems like a cruel joke honestly.

The season was rushed all the way to the end.

933,"Star Wars is screwed.This show's creators suffer from the same thing Dany suffers from. Too much power and expectation on their shoulders. They made a dumb freaking decision to wrap up the last 2 seasons in 13 total episodes instead of 20, which is 7 more character developing episodes we are MISSING! And now the story, and we, all have to endure the consequences.Arya didn't stab Cersei Lannister through her pregnant gut to avenge her brother's wife that died the same way at the wed wedding. Instead, Cersei dies from rocks falling on her because, only 6 episodes.Jamie dies with her instead of perhaps living, or dying differently because they didn't have time to do anything else with him.The Knight king and Bran didn't exchange ANY words, and the Night King died way too quickly. Not enough time to wrap up the story properly.Drogon roasted the iron throne to lava, and Jon Snow's identity being Aegon Targarion doesn't even matter now! Bran has STILL never controlled the dragon ONE time! Drogon remains missing, probably eating his ""mother's"" body, cause, ya know, he eats when he's upset. Like we all are about this entire season.NOT... ENOUGH ... EPISODES!!! They replaced good, proper character development with cool visuals and abrupt moral compas shifts that made NO sense! Burning children makes Dany no better than Anakin Skywalker. And the writing was no better either.Both Any and Dany from both shows shifted way too quickly into utter villainy without proper build up, and gradual moral code breaking. Like Breaking bad, it took 4 seasons for a certain character to poison a kid. But, the moral decline of that character MADE sense!! This entire 8th season of Game of Thrones does NOT make sense. And I think it's because it was too rushed.On behalf of the disappointed fans, and myself, I'm sorry we were put through this. I give the episode a 3 out of 10 for trying to end the best it could... except for the stupid final scene as Jon and the wildlings all walk into the woods because... ???

You have ruined any future rewatches of this great epic with your poor choices and decision to focus on spectacle over substance.
You have taken a redemptive story arc and made the entire journey worthless, unsatisfying and mute.
You have made loyal people treasonous for no logical reason.
You have taken smart characters and made them idiots for the sake of shock and awe.
You have taken good characters and good armies and made them evil for the same purpose.
You have taken strong, worthy characters and turned them into vengeful petty girls because a man rejected them.
You have given unsatisfying, even poisonous endings to villains who the viewers demanded be brought to justice, only to have them escape humiliation, justice, retribution or even to feel bad for their evil acts in any way.
You have made once great characters petty, stupid, vindictive, shallow and even forced them to say petty, stupid, vindictive and shallow things to each other so that we are left with almost no one to cheer for at the end. We literally no longer even care what happens to these shells of these once great characters.
You have forced your fantasy escapist viewers to watch a 45 minute montage of a city being bombed and innocent people being killed. All the while wondering if the destruction was ever going to finally end and we could get back to the story.
You have made weapons be omnipotent in one episode and completely ineffective in the next using no semblance of logic and reason.
You have made armies supposedly the best in the land ineffective and cowardly for no logical reason.
You have made dragon fire be unable to get to a main character who is hiding behind a rock in one episode, then able to concuss with the force of a bunker-busting bomb in a future episode.
You have told us an entire tribe of people was wiped out in one episode only to be miraculously resurrected in the next. And grow even larger in the final episode!
You have killed the joy of this series, killed the chance to ever recommend or share it with future generations, and slaughtered the replay value of what was once a great epic.
You have, literally, killed get-togethers and parties for the end of the show. Who wants to gather with friends to watch the last episode of what has become a depressing train wreck?
My wife and I watched the last episode a night after it aired. We were going to have a big party with friends but after episode one of season eight, that was in doubt. After episode three we knew that wasn't going to happen.

974,"I hope the writers live to regret this disgraceful ending. This show and these characters meant a lot to all of us- to the fans, to the brilliant actors, and countless people working on this monumental production.
D&D squandered all of that for a cheap, unearned ""surprise,"" joke of a twist ending. It really felt like a kick in the gut.
I had friends over at my house! We dressed up, made ""dragon fruit"" drinks and made bets on the ending.
To the writers: you will never get a chance to make something like this again that means so much to so many people and becomes a part of culture the way this has. You had a chance to make something truly meaningful and great. I planned to buy the box set and rewatch the whole thing every few years. Now I want to forget all the time I put into watching the show, reading the books, I regret telling people I respect to watch it. I don't care about the spinoffs. I can't watch the show again now that I know what will happen, I'm just done. Moving on. The ending was THAT bad.

Got became the typical good vs evil show which it always tried to avoid and we got a Disney ending where starks are winning at everything and everyone's else story is just destroyed.
Bran being the king made no sense just like arya killing the night king....it just feels like they tried to shove it down our throats. And they just betrayed this show just in an effort to create room for spinoffs.

Tyrion putting chairs into places had more screen time than actually important scenes (if there were any). Another frustration was Unsullied and Dothraki getting over their Queens death so easily. Really? And they wanted us to cheer on this cheap scenes? It was totally heart braking how poorly they made this season and how they didn't care about the fans at all. At this point no one is arguing about the ending itself, eve if for me it was pure garbage, with no logic at all, like I said, Greyworm got over Danys death like nothing. ZERO SENSE.

That would be better.I'm telling as a hardcore fan of game of thrones, IF they wanted that bad to have only 6 episodes, they had to cut GRRM bullet points and twists and just made from what the show developed until that point, sort of thinking how each character would act in that situation, and what might follow.Even JK Rowling said once that she thought that Hermione could have married Harry in the end. The character that in the book was ""Ugly"" ""Insecure"" ""Timid"" ""Clever"", but since is cast by Emma Watson doesn't quite fit right.I think that Mad Queen and Bran being king is the way that the books will end.

995,"7 PERFECT seasons of the greatest show ever made, a show I've been obsessed with for nearly a decade, hell I've watched the entire first 7 seasons 5+ times...all to watch John Snow ride off into a stale patch of forest with a few wildlings? Nothing changed the FACT that he was the rightful heir to the throne, whether he wanted it or not. Then they throw together Sansa, Arya, Sam and a few other randoms to listen to Tyrion give a speech leading to Bran becoming King while the rightful heir is sitting in a fkn cell as a prisoner whom Bran doesn't even relieve. I do not understand how the devs could have ever possibly imagined perpetrating this on us without being well aware this was pure trash. Seriously WTF?!?!?Im just gonna put it this way.
I mentioned how obsessed I've been with GoT. It's been the most incredible entertainment experience in my entire life. Better than any movie, video game, concert, theme park, sports events....everything. I was so afraid of the show coming to an end, I never wanted it to end. I didn't even like imagining a world without GoT. For the last week I have been contemplating whether or not I would ever even watch the last episode just because I never wanted it to end. Now I seriously wish I would have never watched it. I genuinely feel really bad even having to talk about GoT like this...I never could have even imagined GoT could do anything wrong: As Tyrion spoke of Dany: ""until today.""So so sad....
How could they do this to us?An another note, I have to mention: the Starbucks cup in plain sight was one thing but then a water bottle in plain sight in the finale? Are you kidding me? Don't tell me that WASNT DONE ON PURPOSE! They could have easily CGI'd those two things out for the finished product and didn't. Sure, we all make mistakes, but the Starbucks was literally center-stage. And filming the perfect shots, the perfect angles by elite filmmakers didn't catch these things?

1009,"I only started watching Game of Thrones a couple of months ago. I was recommended it by many people, and with the final season coming out, I thought it was best to start the series.I was blown away by how detailed and unpredictable the show was. Characters were built up brilliantly and killed off just like that, and so many things happened which would not usually happen in normal tv shows. It felt unique, and different to anything I'd ever watched.As soon as I got to season 7, it felt completely different. Dialogue/scenes were more rushed, and characters had plot armour. Important characters were put in situations where you didn't think they would survive, and then they did. This is something that most movies do all the time, and it's something GoT never used to do. The show didn't feel unique anymore, and what made GoT so brilliant was gone.The last season was bad. It was an insult to the fans who watched it from day one. I'd be furious if I had watched it from the start, to finally get to the last season and have it end like this.Don't get me wrong , the actual ending isn't terrible, it was the execution of it. Way too many things happened which didn't really make sense, nor needed to happen. Not enough was explained, and too many things were left unanswered. I understand it was rushed, but it's not how a show like GoT was supposed to end. The final season should have been at least 10 episodes.In the future, when I look back on Game of Thrones I will think of it as a great tv show ruined by its last season. It could have easily been the greatest show of all time, but unfortunately due to its rushed ending, it's nowhere near.",4,27 May 2019,4,5
1010,"I know everyone seems to hate this final season and I understand their point of view but in my opinion if you take it for what it was rather than everything it was missing (which was a lot I admit) it wasn't that bad. Yes some of it didn't make the most sense and was unexpected but isn't that why we all started watching GOT in the first place, because this was the show that didn't play by the traditional rules? Over all I didn't love this episode or this season but I sure didn't hate it either. If they had kept all the same plot points but added another season or even half season to the show I think it would have been WAY better. If you want a positive view on the end for a change this was a pretty good article:",7,23 May 2019,4,5

1014,"The last episode is a great ending of the remarkable TV show. Although, we can all agree the overall quality of the season 8 is not at the level we all are used to, giving 1 star to this episode just because you are not satisfied who lives and who dies, who becomes a king, and who not, is insult to Game of Thrones. Neither episode should be below 7 stars, not speaking about this ridiculous 4.8.",8,20 May 2019,4,5
1015,"I don't think I loved this episode. But... I do think I liked it a lot. It certainly never brought me to the highs Game of Thrones has in the past (the final shot of season seven gives me chills just to think about), but I'm wholly satisfied with the way it ended this beast of a show. This entire season has felt (and been) incredibly rushed, the writers being so intent on finishing what feels like a season and a half of story in just six scripts. Obviously, that's kind of insane. If I'm ever about to plowed into by a shooting star or find a weird lamp in a desert, I promise you that I'll wish for Game of Thrones to finish in season ten, like it was clearly supposed to. But all of that rushing has been to get to this episode, to get all of the characters and plot points neatly in place for tying up/stabbing in a throne room. My greatest fear was that this episode would rush too, that it wouldn't be the light at the end of a tunnel and would just be an extra three miles of tunnel to sprint through. But it wasn't! This episode was slow, and thoughtful, bringing out some of the best from its actors (I get that this season is going to be totally panned come award season, but Peter Dinklage obviously deserves something for the last two episodes).I feel there's been a momentum building this past season, a momentum of hating what has certainly been sub-par storytelling without any willingness to actually engage with it critically, away from the maddening, review-bombing crowd. I truly believe that this episode is worth more than a one star, one sentence review calling Benioff and Weiss something childish or asking IMDb to install a zero star rating. Please, hate his episode all you want - I'm not here to police your opinion - but try and do it from a genuine place. Somewhere deeper than the base response of the collective internet. What's the worst case scenario? You like your favourite show's last episode a little more?I'm disappointed that this episode wasn't the greatest two hours of television ever delivered, truly I am. But I'm satisfied. Game of Thrones can rest easily in my head, a fantastic show with a brilliant story to tell. It sprinted for the finish line, fell over itself in the last six metres (bear with me here), but it landed with its hands still in the air and took a deep, slow dignified breath.
That sounded better in my head. It was fine!!",8,20 May 2019,4,5

She was one of the main characters with an incredible arc, and she was reduced to an afterthought. It almost makes me feel ill. And then whatever that was with Bran. Endings are supposed to give fans a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. It doesn't need a neat little bow, but it shouldn't make us say ""That's it?"" And that's how I felt. I even waited after the credits to see if there would be anything more, but no. Mostly I just feel sad and empty, but also a little relieved.

1036,"The writers probably wanted to shock the audience with the last GOT episode but they did that in the worst way possible, one that doesn't make any sense. Fire-spitting dragons make more sense than what happened in the last 2 episodes.And here's a scenario similar to what happened the last GOT episode:Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are racing for the presidency of the US. The country is split between them and heavy political battles are taken.All of the sudden, the republicans and democrats agree that they should make Google president because it's got a better story. It knows everything about us, just like Bran, it's outmatched all other search engines and he can fly a drone and learn things, just like Bran flew his ravens. In a fun way, we could also call Google the 3-eyed raven as it know everything too.Now as a person living in America, how would you feel about that? You'd be puzzled, right?All the time, you were preparing to vote for Donald or Hillary and some guys decide that it's better to shock you and name Google president of the US.This is exactly what happened in GOT last episode.Many have fought and died for the Iron Throne, while Bran/Google who barely appeared throughout the series fell from the window and landed on the throne. Mind-boggling.But wait there's more...Jon Snow who was the one who would always stood true to his oaths, decides to murder his queen and lover. Don't get me wrong, maybe she deserved it after the previous episode (which was even more mind-boggling and frustrating than this one), but Jon Snow is the one who killed his commander in the Night Watch only after he killed Jon Snow first. This really wasn't the guy to stab his lover/queen to death.And it just goes on...Torgo Nuddo arrests Jon Snow and then easily hands him to a council with a promise that he will live in Castle Black for the rest of his days. Why would he do that? He won the war and was in charge. Why not punish Jon Snow himself? And why leave back after winning the war?But here's the best part...Do you remember Bronn? That guy that stood Tyrion's back in the first few season and then went awall, missing all the wars?Well, he is back and is now Master of Coins. Why? you may wonder? Did Bronn ever show accounting or managerial abilities? Did he fight those last bloody wars?
The writers probably wanted to make a joke with this but in return they made a mockery of the entire movie.And I really love how Bran/Google concludes his first meeting as a king:Bran: Where is Drogon?
Others: Flying east the last we heard.
Bran: Maybe I can find him. Carry on with whatever it was that you were doing...
And then he exists the scene.I am sure Google/Siri/Alexa could have done better than that, so as I was saying, in the next presidential election expect to see Google as president. After all it is more present in our lives than Bran ever was in this movie.",1,21 May 2019,25,49

This is not Game of Thrones .. it never was .. it's the show that killed the character on the cover in the 1st season!!!
Season 8 has so many plot holes that the entire Pacific would cover them and it's shows George RR Martin wasn't part of the last season script.
So many personality changes instant or totally opposite of what the 7 seasons build them so far. Some were even in the same episode. We all saw Unusllied instant reaction when Jon tried to stop Grey Worm .. you want us to believe they agree to go play farmville after they found out (no idea how - no witness - no weapon - no body) that Jon killed their Queen .. The one ruler they know who freed them and their families ? And Dothraki blood thirsty warriors just decided to leave ?
And after we all saw the dead storm out Winterfell covering everything, leaving almost nobody alive, each episode after that armies grew bigger and bigger in just a few days.
And the 20k Golden Company done in 2 shots ? And Sansa threatening with a big army .. were those just armors on sticks or something ?
And who decides the new king .. some characters in that meeting where shown for the 1st time in season 8 there, or even for the 1st time in Game of Thrones !!! Some (like Yara or the Prince of Dorne) never even met the Starks and were sworn to Dany actually.
And all those stories or prophecies build up left in the wind.
All those white walkers vs all those named Valeryan steels .. and nothing.

They completely butchered the 8 year old character development for several characters, robbed the fans from ALL the good stories (Like the Golden Company's true loyalty) and did sooo stupid stuff (e.g. Battle of Winterfell and the death of Rhaegal). It all makes me think: did the producers even read and/or understand the books? At least the fans are comforted with GRRM's upcoming books who will follow his vision.",1,20 May 2019,25,49

The bad reviews through the season was never about tge story not fitting the fans theory. It's always been about the season progressed when it came to writing, shock value over logic and foreshadowing instead of character building.
There is ofcourse so much to say regarding absolute disregard to character development through out the seasons that was completely forgotten & definitely the main complaint about Daenerys character that took a complete change in the other direction in a matter of 2 episodes and expected of fans to accept it. It just made the fans go back GRRM books & writings & reminisce about the good old days when characters were built, showed you what they are and writers didn't need to come after an episode explaining why the characters changed their minds or completely ""forgot"" about their personality last minute.",2,20 May 2019,20,38

I won't detail all the points that make no sense at all, nor the destruction of the characters evolution...
but there is one thing I can't hold...
Bran is able to see the future. He saw drogon flying over kingslanding (the show won't show you dany slaughtering the city for obvious reasons), he gave Arya the dagger because he knew she will need it in order to kill the night king, he went to kingslanding because he knew he will become king (why do you think I came all this way?), he said Jon 'you were exactly where you were supposed to be', ... so once he became the three eye raven he knew...
Doesn't this make him the worst villain of the entire show?? Dany had to be killed because he murdered inocent people... Bran knew it and said nothing!
It is an interesting twist I have to admit even though I do not like it. What's bothering me is all the characters seem to be idiots and not realize it.... what's even worse they named him king!

1083,"What a travesty.What basically happened here is the two main makers of the show, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, got a golden deal in Hollywood making the next Star Wars trilogy. GoT was cut from a planned 10 season run to 8 seasons, with two seriously gimped last seasons, and increasingly lazy and uninspired writing.The makers of this show had over a decade built up this incredible support, dedication and loyalty from their vast fan base, and then decided to take a big, steamy dump (that is season 8) on the whole thing. What were they thinking? Benioff and Weiss should have left after season 6, and found someone else up to the task of gradually taking over the reins.The show threw us a lot of curveballs, which is fine, but NOT for the last couple of episodes. What's worse, there are so many plot holes, anti-climactic deaths of main characters, inconsistent character behavior and illogical scenes in the last season, it's ridiculous. All the wonderful build-up ended up with arguably the most lackluster finale in TV-history, compared to the previous quality of the show.With a proper conclusion to the show, imagine all the further possibilities - PC games, movies, spin-off series, Blue-ray sales etc., but now all down the drain. Who's going to emotionally invest in the GoT-universe anymore, with a ruinous ending like that? Maybe a few, but only a fraction of what would otherwise have been. Will there even be a spin-off series now after all this negativity? Nearly all the interesting characters have either been killed off or ruined by terrible writing. I couldn't care less at this point, to be honest.There's so much more to criticize here, but I'm done. I will never revisit this show again, and will do my best to erase it from my memory.

Pathetic joke of all time (the one man who never wanted a throne or deserved it) If I was the director I would have made him Master of stories instead of making him the king.2) Jon snow becomes the king slayer? Wow this character suffered the most in this whole series, if I was Jon I would have accepted execution instead of becoming nights watch again.
The dragon was surely having a developed brain instead of you two as he spared Jon even after the vicious murder he committed.3) Arya Stark was there just to show off her pretty face? She killed people by the hundreds wearing mask, its her fate to kill the last tyrant alive. Its her fate to be the assassin and liberator of the seven kingdoms. You throw her in a brig and exile her so she can find a new world to rule? WOW PATHETIC4) Drogon melted the iron throne for no reason as you can see the idiots surrounding Brandon stark are gonna assassinate him one day. Some other idiot will forge the iron throne back and surely gonna rule the westeros with his family rising upwards.5) According to me Jon was the perfect candidate to rule the 7 kingdoms. I can bet you wanted a twist in the story because you had more power in the pen as directors but if you apply your brain the best ruler is the one who is JUST and merciful, strong and skilled. Jon acquired these qualities from Ned Stark and no one else did that.If you were just trying to break the wheel then boohoo you failed man, you just paved the way for the rise of new candidates and brainless creatures who will be the part of this wheel and we know there is no happy ending to the brandon stark story.",1,21 May 2019,12,21

keep aside all the revelations but Bran .. I mean seriously ...for some cheap thrills !!!!!. I felt like I am watching some crime series in which the killer will be the one who look innocent and you don't doubt on him/her throughout the episode. But the good thing there is they try to justify why and how that guy did the crime unlike here.You can't justify by putting below statement in bran's mouth .
""What you think ,why did I came here"". Wow!!!!Arya stark who once told ""I am Arya stark of winterfell and I am going home"" suddenly does not want to be at home rather want to explore the world. The exploration point was that she wanted to know what is in the west of Westeros.. Come on !!! Your brother , the broken king, three eyed raven could have easily helped you.Dodhrokis ; who were the first ones to be killed in the long night , what are they doing in the king's landing with double in number. Even if they survived(which I still disagree) , how didn't they do anything to John after he kills Dany(they are meant to be brutal ones and could have burnt John alive after knowing he kills their queen) .

I was one of the few people who read the books long before HBO started the series. I specifically remember reading it saying ""oh my God these books remind me of Lord of the Rings meets The Sopranos"". Are always raved about the books. And then lo and behold Dumb and Dumber also realized how awesome the books were and brought it to HBO to make a series of. And lo and behold a legendary television series was born.

It could have not been expected a happy ending, with Targaryen babies flying on cute little dragons...this is GoT afterall.
I understand why the writers thought Bran is the best fit for the throne, they did hint every since the first season with stories like Bran the Builder and other dialogues, that even crippled, he could be in the King's council or rebuild cities.
Unfortunately, there was no character developement for Bran into this direction, no way to understand, feel or connect in any positive or negative way with his character. And there have been many great opportunities for Bran to deliver great dialogue, or wisdom, or make viewers relate in any way with the character. If the writer's intention for muting this powerful character so many seasons was to make sure he doesn't reveal anything conclusive for the show's ending, I still think they could have made this character some sort of good/evil intelligent life form with simply better dialogue/ story instead of an absentee warg in a wheelchair.
Also, there are way too many loose ends in the main story, side stories completely ignored, very poor dialogue, too many cliches. Not even if they left room for prequels or sequels could ever explain why they ended 8 years in complete nonsense!Overall, it seems that the need to have an unexpected and shocking show simply exceeds the need to have a coherent & clever game of thrones.",7,20 May 2019,12,21

I would not even start complaining about the main illogical problems from the last season: killing the knight king by Arya's teleportation or Rhaegal death etc.So the ending of GOT:
I don't understand Bran's story and how he managed to be the king. In the last seasons... Bran acts like a zombie: he said he doesn't leave in the present anymore and can't be lord of Winterfell ( because he is the 3 eyed Revan)... but 2 seasons later he can be the king of the six kingdoms. Even more, as the 3 eyed raven doesn't he live more than an average person? As I remember the last 3 eyed Revan lived for more than 1000 years. Does anything of this make sense for you?Also, I found it interesting that all/most of the main characters are dead or had a tragic ending, after all their sacrifices and struggles. But the secondary/ supporting characters have a happy ending, even though most of them didn't do much for it, they were just there...
The writers were like: ""let's make a shock factor by ruining all the main characters, but give the happy ending through the other ... so fans will be satisfied ""I can't say I am disappointed, because that would mean that I just expected more and the last season was decent (it wasn't decent, so I am disgusted).",1,20 May 2019,21,41

Expectations weren't high after the Night King going out with a whimper, dragons getting wiped out with a single shot then avoiding all manner of armoury.
But the saddest thing was the crushing realisation that after investing all our belief in the destiny of Dany and Jon we see one inexplicably turn into a mad power crazed b**ch and the other into a mumbling monosyllabic support act.
And the most depressing thing? Well it was obvious Dany was going to die. Setting aside the predicability it was a powerful scene - but the greatest character in the history of the show didnt even merit an end of episode bumping off. Instead we got treated to a woeful scene (probably the worst in the entire show) where the dribs and drabs not deemed cool enough to kill off contrived a totally unsatisfactory 'compromise' .

If Bran knows and sees he will be king, by exposing Jon Snows true identity
he basicly eliminated Jon Snow and Daenarys by themselves.
If he never mentioned this to Jon and Jon to Daenarys they will be probably ruling the realm together. Maybe then Daenarys won't be the mad queen. And everybody will be happy. So Bran definetly not deserves ruling. Shame on you HBO.",1,20 May 2019,17,32

Incredible loyalty towards the killed inihillator queen who wasn't even the rightful heir to the throne? Unreasonable judgment towards Jon Snow who was the rightful heir to the throne and the one who put an end to the massacre and who saved the entire world?

I feel like they're insulting my intelligence by assuming that maybe I won't notice that the writing is bad as long as it looks good.This final episode was like DB Weiss and David Benioff asked casual watchers how they'd like the show to end and adapted their wishes exactly:""Make Brienne Lord Commander of the Kingsguard!""
""Reunite Jon with Ghost!""
""Make Sansa Queen of Winterfell!""
""Make Sam an Arch Maester!""

The meeting with all the lords as they decide the next ruler was a joke. I couldn't help but laugh. They tried to interject some jokes, but it just didn't fit and was poorly executed. Not to mention that their decision to make Bran king is wholly unjustified. It felt like they were set on making Bran king and they forced an explanation that was convincing at all. Overall, there's a lot I could say about the last season of GoT and how the story was handled, but I'll leave it at that. It's unfortunate that this last season will hurt the legacy of GoT.

Like I said, I really wasn't expecting anything anymore, other than a very cliché ending. And that's what I/we got, but in the worst way (at least I hoped Dany would burn Sansa and Tyrion as traitors and Jon would die).So let's check what went wrong:
So Dany is in the throne room without any guards? It's not like the city could still have some Lannister soldiers or a nut with a knife lurking around, right?Drogon? What was he thinking? So he apparently is smart enough to know about the throne and all, but doesn't mind a dagger in his mother?So Jon is just ""arrested"" after killing the Queen?Remember season 2? After Renly is killed by the shadow? Does ANYONE give Brienne a fair trial or takes her prisoner? Nope, they immediately want to murder her for killing their king. Why on earth would Unsullied be any more merciful?
Also, Varys got arrested and seemingly executed on the spot. Tyrion gets to stick around long enough, so he can survive? Oh come on, F#&% YOU, Show!Speaking of Varys, where was Jon's defense for him last episode? Tyrion got one and he was ALWAYS wrong since...season 5?So democracy is laughed at, but Bran is chosen? WHY? He was useless the entire show! He can't have kids(so what about after he dies?).Dany wanted to break the wheel, but I don't see that happening. First of all, I don't see what makes Bran a good leader or king(at least not why he would be better than Tommen with Kevan Lannister). And since apparently, people still don't have any choice and some elitists decide, what has changed? Basically, Dany and Cersei just did the rest a favour by killing off most leaders in Westeros apparently.
Speaking of that, why does Bronn get THREE kingdoms/castles? Where the heck was he anyway during the last episode? He just came back to collect? Why should people in the reach or Highgarden or Blackwater accept him? Aren't there hundreds of others who have a better claim? Sounds more like a new dictator than breaking the wheelSo Bran is the king and the Unsullied(who never swore to any king) just listen to him? Gimme a break! Also, if they apparently DO accept him as an authority figure, why can they just leave? Isn't that a contradiction? And what do they want to do on Misandei's isle? They can't have kids or anything. Would have made more sense to turn them into sell swords or something at leastLord Tully is released from the dungeon, but nobody bothers to check where Ellaria is? Isn't she still the ruler of Dorne(if it wasn't for the Prince-Ex-Machina, although we saw the ONLY prince get killed in season 6)? Not even a question as for her whereabouts?What happened to the Dothrakis?What about Gilly and her two kids?Why the heck is Sam a Maester now? He is basically a drop-out who disobeyed all the rules. Great example for kids who watch the show...The Wildlings just waited for weeks/months, apparenty KNOWING that Jon would come? Are you kidding me?Speaking of that: Since Jon himself says the Nightwatch has no point and all, wasn't he supposed to be exiled there as a PUNISHMENT? If he can leave as he pleases and no one seems to care, how is that justice?I really don't understand why George R.R. Martin would give his creation into the hand of such bad writers, unless he wanted to sabotage the show(probably to sell more books). There is that rumour that the last 2 books are finished and I still kind of expect them to be released this or next year. Because I just don't want to believe that a man who doesn't seem like a complete idiot wouldn't see how bad these writers are. And I sincerely hope he didn't give us such a sappy ending in the books.Seriously, this whole show was NOT about such a lame ""happy"" end(and it was only happy if you didn't hate the Starks like I do by now anyway).
If it was supposed to end like this, why not just let Robb win in season 3? Or Stannis in season 2?What exactly makes the Starks the ""right"" rulers or the ""good"" guys?
The wars they fought(basically for their own selfish reasons, although one can argue if saving their king is selfish, but he also was their father) devastated the North. Actually, after episode 3, I'd be surprised if they had more than 50 fighting men(although the same goes for Dothraki and Unsullied). Not to mention the famine. The Riverlands are destroyed as well. The Starks always used others for their purpose (Vale Army, Karstarks, Umbers, etc.). What did those houses get in return?Basically, it seems that the show is telling you ""Meh, everyone will lose unless they are our/the fans favourites. Selfishness will triumph as long as we get the ending we wanted.""And I just don't feel that THAT was the idea of this show.",1,20 May 2019,16,30

All of the suspense and character development over 7 seasons and they end it like this? I'm beyond disappointed and am honestly shocked they actually aired something this atrocious. I can't put it into words.. This whole season deserves a 1/10 because it ruined the previous 7 seasons and destroyed the best t.v. show ever made.

1210,"Everything in this episode was so rushed that important plot points felt unearned and fell flat with me. I felt nothing when Jon killed Dany except that it was a surprise it happened so soon in the episode. It should have made an impact on me. I should have felt something about her death. I have watched her grow over the years and have cheered for her, yet I felt nothing. Sort of the same feeling I had about the Jon and Dany romance from last season. It wasn't developed enough like Brienne/Jaime or even Rob/Talisa. I didn't believe it.I also have a difficult time believing that Grey Worm would not have killed Jon (or Tyrion for that matter) the moment he found out he was responsible for Dany's death. We just saw him executing Lannister soldiers for doing less moments earlier in the episode. It makes no sense to me.What are we supposed to make of Bran as king? Can he see the future or not? He implied he can since he said ""why do you think I came all this way?"" So if he can, why did he allow all those innocent people to be murdered in KL? Is Bran the real villain here?Am I also to believe that Yara would not have voiced her opinion as Sansa did about being independent? She felt very strongly about this issue when she made the pact with Dany.Lastly, there was such a build up of Jon being Targaryen and foreshadowing that Dany could be pregnant but none of that mattered. So many threads were dead ends for seemingly no reason at all.I have followed this show obsessively along with the books and I just feel let down, especially by this episode but overall for the past 2 seasons of GoT. The actors were amazing, the cinematography was amazing, the music was amazing. Everything was amazing except the writing. I feel if there had been at least one more season this amazing story could have been brought to an end with the ending it deserved.",3,28 May 2019,10,17

GoT: ""Hold my beer...""I feel so bad for the actors and George RR Martin. Imagine spending a decade curating the best show in history, only to be crucified by Dumb & Dumber. This episode - and season in fact - was the biggest piece of rank sewage ever written in TV history.It's just so needlessly horrendous. 8 years of build up, 8 years of pacing, 8 years of complex unpredictable plot, all flushed down the toilet.It was a fantasy series, yes. But everything, within the logic of that world, made sense. This season, though, the writers just threw reality out. The show was so good because it was unpredictable, because main characters died. In the battle with the Night King, no one major died. And seriosuly? That's how the night king dies? We've been told for 8 years that the long night is the biggest threat and fighting over the Throne is futile, yet the big culminating battle lasts 1 episode, he dies so easily and none of the major characters die? What...? The only main characters who die are Cersi, Jamie and Danny and both deaths you can see it coming a 10 lightyears away. And reformer turns tyrant is so predictable; Hunger Games anyone?It's so rushed. So many major plot lines they just discarded in their haste to finish and move on to $tar wars. HBO offered 10 seasons, but they insisted on ruining it with speed. Jon was a Targaryen for nothing. Arya spend 2 seasons becoming a faceless assassin for nothing.So many rushed parts, logical flaws, character inconsistencies, deviations from essence and laughably predictable outcomes. Individually they'd be forgiven, but together. No, no, no.Acting, directing, photography, music all brilliant. But the writing is a joke. Such a wasted opportunity.

What happened after Jon killed daenerys? (A bit too hard to explain?).
How can Tyrion - prisioner at the time - got out of his cell to be presented to lords and ladies and he was the one who ended up deciding everything?
Why on earth did Drogon just disappeared, when a Targaryen still existed?
Cersei's death? Ridiculous - crying over how she wanted her baby to live? Where did that come from?
Jaimie's fight with what's-his-name - where did that come from? How unnecessary was that?
Arya's list, that moved her ever since I don't even know when, suddenly was not so important, the moment she arrived at king's landing....?I could go on. I just won't because it breaks my heart. It was TOO bad to be true.

1242,"I have never been a long time Game of Thrones fan, I only started watching the show in 2016 when I started borrowing my friends DVDs. I do remember enjoying the first two seasons and thinking it was very well excecuted and planned out television, even though it was an adaptation of George R R Martin's books and not an original story per se. As the seasons went by, it looked like GOT was shaping up to be one of the best ever fantasy adaptations up there with Harry Potter and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.However from seasons 6 and onwards, things started to get strangely murky for the series because there we no more of George's books to adapt, so D&D decided to wing it from that point onward and make the rest of the story as they went along hoping that they could almost flawlessly nail the landing. The quality of the production of Game of Thrones aswell as the quality of the acting never dipped in these final three seasons, but the writing quality started to dip downward and steadily decline until the now infamous final season of Game of Thrones was released in early 2019You could tell that the writers of the show were fumbling and desperately try to find a satisfying ending to the series, but as time went on, S8 really was a revelation that David Harbour and DB Weiss didn't really have much of an idea of what they were doing creatively since before S6, they were simply and efficiently adapting GRRM's creative work to the screen without really putting any creative input to the writing themselves. And it's a crying shame too, because there are many fan theories and speculations that were miles better than what fans were finally delivered in that season.There had been speculation that Danaerys should have descended into insanity with a couple of more seasons documenting her descent Breaking Bad style, and that would have been awesome to see. Speaking of Breaking Bad, maybe if Vince Gilligan was on the GOT team, he could have given us a badass and satisfying GOT ending that fans wanted and deserved for following the show for almost a decade.It makes me scared to become deeply emotionally invested in long term TV shows with lots of plot points and emotional moments to end up with such an antithesis of an ending. I felt empty after finishing Game of Thrones, and I only spent a total of about 2-3 months watching the whole thing, and I haven't gone back to rewatching it again until now, because frankly I was very overwhelmed and intimidated by the whole combined negative online response by so many angry longtime fans, that I didn't want to develop an opinion on the wrong side of the argument, or even more conclusively the truth on whether I liked the ending, thought it was lacking in some aspects, or completely despised it like so many other reviews on this IMDb page.But the truth is, is that I don't feel either way about this episode and the finale, apart from some emptiness and confused disappointment, thinking ""oh is that how it's ending, is that it? Oh well..."" I simply felt empty, and that's not a good feeling to have at the end of a show as long as this.Reflecting on it two years later now, this really is an ending no long time fan could've seen coming, and I can only imagine what a cold stab to the heart it must have been to anyone who was crazy about this show and fully invested from Season 1 only to have it all leaving up to... well, whatever this turned out to be 🔪🖤It makes me scared that something like this will happen in the future of television, and we'll never see it coming or be able to avoid it.",4,22 April 2021,5,7

Cersei and Jaime died a poetic death, the only two people in the world - as the world crumbled around them. Episode 2 simply moved me to tears.And then, suddenly, somehow, the once witty, wonderful Tyrion suggests that Bran - the most nothing character on the show - be king. Remember when the dialogues were all: 'chaos is a ladder' and 'you win or you die' and 'there's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand'? Now we get: 'Bran the broken has the best story' and everybody smiles and nods politely. This is not Game of Thrones. This is high school student theatre at its most mediocre.Then Bran is thankfully wheeled off, Tyrion gets written out of Westerosi history, Arya becomes Dora the explorer, and Jon is somehow, for some reason, at the wall again.The tone is just so off!

I don't want to die.."", Jon would be reduced to a cowardly spectator, Jaime would run back home like a lost child, Tyrion would become naive and innocent, and Arya would become an explorer, I would've actually clapped my hands. That would have been so good a joke that I could never have even come up with it.But best of all. Bran is the king. The one character who I couldn't have cared to have existed. Well if that is the punchline, then it's a damn good one.The scene where Samwell present the book of ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" almost felt like the characters themselves were mocking the show, they sounded so stupidly content with their poor decisions.

All the characters we've watched for nearly 10 years suddenly fall flat as cardboard cutouts, whereas Bran and Grey Worm have more charisma out of the whole bunch.Bran becoming the King was about the only foreshadowing the showrunners managed to pull off successfully. Bran didn't want to be the lord of Winterfell, but he never elaborated on it. Sure enough, we got our answer in the finale.Overall,season 8 felt like the most expensive Fanfiction ever conceived. The showrunners really dropped the ball on the Night King, Danny and especially Jon. Season 1-6 Jon and Danny were the TRUE Jon and Danny. After that, they both became love interests side characters in their own story. It makes you wish Jon stayed dead at the end of season 5. If we knew what we know now, that had been a better fate for him.On a side note...I feel bad for Disney, though lol. They hired the last people on Earth to prolong their 2020s Star Wars franchise.

I thought he was there to join that meeting.Jon was seriously the best part of this season. I mean, he was always the best best part for me since S1. He's my number one favorite. But especially in this mess was he the best part. He killed Dany in her ridiculously short lived evil queen status.... Drogon chose not to fry him because of his adamantium plot armor and instead melted the Throne Jon was heir to.Later he was sent back to....the Watch and became a member....once again....to a place that was his lowest point...even considering he was King of the North...a role he absolutely earned..... This is why he was resurrected? Not to battle the NK and possibly defeat him like I was sure all that build up was for since with each episode since his rank as Lord Commander of the Watch with all he was doing which later on he becomes King of the North and would maybe defeat the NK while in that role as King of the North? Ight.This didnt feel like a series finale. We watch Arya go off to a better place I guess and Sansa becomes Queen of the North. Nothing after that? Would have been something if Jon ruled as King of the North and have Sansa as Queen of the North. Maybe would have worked since they are not even blood kin. Maybe Jon would refuse the Throne and offer it to Jaime after Cersei's defeat. Just spit balling.Not much else I can speak about because nothing else happened. Well, Dany sent Tyrion to the cell just because he quit being her hand after she completely fried all those innocent folks, even with all his other ridiculous mistakes she just shrugged off earlier. He quit being her Hand, which is not even close to a crime, and was jailed for it. Gotcha.Idk, y'all. This season didnt sit right with me one bit.",2,23 May 2019,9,15

WTH ??
Varys dies without explaining why he was mutilated as a child and what was his purpose all throughout the seasons and not to mention Jon Snow going back to beyond the wall ?

1314,"The hallmark of Game of Thrones for me has always been the show's ability to juggle a dozen storylines at once with ease. So many characters, so many conflicts, always an excess of social politics. So someone tell me why this final episode has approximately 3 storylines (the fate of Dany, the fate of Jon, and the fate of the throne). Tell me why Jon and Tyrion are the only characters deserving of impactful ending. Tell me why Bran, a character with very little development and complexity in this season, became the penultimate individual.It comes down to something very simple. This season needed more episodes. You'll see I left 3 stars due to the fact that, as wasted as it was, the acting, special effects, visuals, score, and stunts were INCREDIBLE. Game-changing. History making. Undeniably fantastic. The sad truth is that they were wasted on 6 episodes that had no writing to back them up. If less time went into large-scale sequences (that were NEVER what made Game of Thrones great), then more time could have been put into a dozen more episodes that honed in on Bran's rise, Sansa's need for northern sovereignty, Arya's random desire to be Christopher Columbus, Brienne, Davos, etc.. In this dream scenario, perhaps we would have gotten more than 2 storylines in this finale.As I look back, the only way I can stomach this final season is to imagine the true Game of Thrones ended after Season 6. What S7 and S8 were, then, were Hollywood adaptions of the show; movies that pandered to the most glamorous storylines in an attempt to satisfy casual fans. That is the only reason why they exempted what a true fan would want: the nitty gritty details. How are they rebuilding the wall? Where the hell is the dragon? When did Podrick get his new title? The list goes on. Things only the book will be able to tell us now.Also- one last thing- ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" being the history book for Westeros? Y'all smell that cheese?",3,20 May 2019,34,73

This show could of been the greatest series to ever exist by far.Generations to come would of admired the great talent and details that went into the first 6 seasons. But for reasons way beyond my comprehension the writers or Hbo decided to rush the final season 2 seasons. Basically in my opinion ruining what could have been the greatest series of all time. I am totally thankful to D&D and Hbo for giving me the opportunity to enjoy such a great show but at the same time I am totally disappointed with D&D and Hbo for ruining this amazing experience.

1323,"The final two episodes were very poorly written. Daenerys freed thousands from slavery, and when the masters attacked Mereen, she intelligently used three dragons to retaliate without damaging the entire fleet. More than half of the ships she sailed to Westeros with were secured from the masters' fleet, yet the masters did not surrender. Daenerys' unexpected torching of Kingslanding and the stemming genocide after the city surrendered is a shamless defilement of her character.Tyrion led the defense of Kingslanding when Stannis attacked. He used wildfire to burn the invaders alive in ships, all as part of the war effort. Varys recognized and appreciated Tyrions effort multiple times. All of a sudden, Tyrion and Varys begin to criticize Daenerys for burning the Tally's who refused to bend the knee or take the black. They begin to question her state of mind and perceive her as a threat absent logical explanation, yet only briefly before she had abandoned the Southern war her self interest notwithstanding and rode North to fight the dead.The writing to be honest was inconceivably lunatic, unexpected and deficient. A predictable ending would have had a better chance at solidifying this masterpiece as the greatest show of all time. It's a shame that the hardwork of all these great actors, directors and crew receives unanimous condemnation.The Network should recognize the show's potential and salvage this situation perhaps by shooting a movie, a few more episodes or something to correct the mistakes the writers made in the last season. I don't know how they'll do it to be honest, but restorative action needs to be taken.",1,24 April 2020,8,13

1337,The finale was unsatisfying and uninspired. The show left many plots thread to dangling and many things they had given hints or foreshadowing to actually went nowhere there was no twist no anything really. It seems like Jon Snow's character ended after season 6. He essentially became a shell of himself things he would never do or never tolerate he tolerated he essentially became a lap dog and his parentage reveal was not even a story for him at all. His entire story with Daenerys was cringe-worthy and pathetic it didn't maybe with any emotion but what the frek happened to Jon Snow The character bran should have gotten more development for what his endgame was going to be. His master of coin was a horrible choice and The Book Song of Fire and Ice being used was incredibly cheesy never getting to see the pack together or actually working together was a huge letdown this season lacked many emotional Beats and that was done in order to focus on Daenerys.

And then comes this final episode which is a total wreck.
I still don't know what really happened?
Why the Unsullied took Jon as a prisoner? Absolutely out of a character moment for them. They would had executed him without a question.
Why the dragon left Jon to be? Those moron writers just couldn't let Drogon to burn Jon to reveal that he is Targaryan. That would had made some sense, but no. It's enough for Drogon to burn down the throne.
In the council scene nobody remembers that they were hailing Jon as a king just an episode ago. They don't even mention him, not even Arya or Sansa who have always loved their brother. Instead they choose Bran because the little man says that he has a good story.
Yeah, for sure. The best story in the realm. Our staring wonder boy who flies with birds is an awesome ruler for sure.
And I don't even actually mind Bran to be a king, but the way how writers constantly forgot every plot point they made earlier in the series and even in this season and instead just made new ones really make this ending a total garbage. A wasted opportunity.

Tyrion finding his siblings and crying was a moving scene at a speech to Jon about what Daenerys was was like talking to the audience. However Jon Snow has been bizarre and out-of-character all season the only thing he can ever say about Daenerys she's the queen or my queen with a face of disgust and fear like he's an abused boyfriend. I believe they are trying to sell this as a tragic love story but the writing did not carry that there was no build up in season 7 and no chemistry no passion it was bland&unbelievable and probably worse attempt at a love story in television. It seemed disappointing to reward tyrion. And let the unsullied dictate what happens in Westeros or the fact that yara was okay with Daenerys abandon her and and why the other kingdoms didn't ask for their freedom as well . Sansa spent the entire season trying to keep John and power and keep him safe and she's one of the smartest characters but it was sad to see her Queen of the North with no hand of the queen no Knight and no her partner Jon Jon's ending with the worst he belongs in Winterfell he always want to be a stark not with the wildlings free and if it couldn't be he should have been left to clean up the mess in King's Landing. his parentage secret has been there since the beginning of the show and it actually equal to nothing it didn't matter at all a lot of the foreshadowing in the show the whole Sansa played as romantic jealous of Daenerys sansa&John's chemistry in season 6 mera reed dropped, vary's sending all those Scrolls about Jon being the true king led to nothing. They should have use bran more if he was going to be king but it also felt like a cop-out like the Supernatural is an answer to politics.

Bran(whose actor was the only one defending this season), becomes a king out of nowhere, even though he hadn't said a single impactful line of diologue this season and was just an emotionless bait for NK. This is beyond butchered. He is only chosen a King just because of one dialogue.
I don't mind the ""Mad Queen"" scenario. I just don't like how we got there. There was no buildup for her burning the KL. Yes, we've seen her do cruel things, but she also acted right and was about defending the innocents. She helped save the world from NK, and she also experienced the loss of her loved ones before, yet it didn't lead to her burning the entire cities.
This story arc could be fixed by showing her descent into madness contiously over a full 10 episode season at the very least. HBO, in fact, had been strongle for the ""10 season saga"", but D&D told them that 6 episodes would be enough for them, which is likely due to the offer they got from Disney to work on the next Star Wats trilogy. At least, if you make this season short and decide to rush it, don't go for the ""shock value"" like you did in ep 4 with Rhaegal and in ep 3 with NK, but give those meaning. Make them being worked for.
For example:
John's story could be fixed more by making him the one to kill the Night King, since why was he revived then? Azor ahai? No? If you decide to go with Arya, at least show us how she works for it instead of going for the shock value with no meaning or support behind it.
Killing Rhaegal in the Episode 5 instead, when the Bells rang and the last scorpion shot fired into him(when Dany was still sitiing on that wall) and people cheering for his death would mean much more and show us the reasoon for her going mad.These writers get millions of dollars from being tasked with writing for the highest rated TV show of this decade, and making these kinds of choices of butchering an entire saga just for a fast carreer progression(offer from star wars) should cost them their carreers at least.

1399,"Anyone giving this episode 10/10 and arguing that it is a good episode that makes sense, or that this is what GOT is, most likely has bad taste or they are die hard fans unwilling to accept, that their show became bad.I, as someone who has read all the books and watched all the episodes of the show, fell deeply disappointed. It is not because of the ending, because we all know that a happy ending isn't possible in GOT. It is the way in which the ending was presented that is awful. The whole episode and season are filled with illogical happenings and plot holes.
John was simply reduced to a side character. The whole thing with his resurrection, the thing that he is a Targaryen, that he is the rightful her to the throne were thrown out of the window. It is completely irrelevant, rendering the whole build up of Johns character for the past seven seasons useless. But then again, this whole season makes the previous seven seasons completely unnecessary. The only point of John being there was to kill Daenerys and that's it. He is sentenced to again take up the black, which by itself doesn't make any sense. Why does the Nights Watch even exist at this point, if the wildlings are now peaceful and the Night King is defeated. It also doesn't make sense, because the unsullied sail away, which means, that John, Bran the Broken and Sansa the queen in the North could have waited for them to leave and then simply break the promise they made to the unsullied. Also, how did the unsullied notice that John killed Daenerys? There were no guards and Drogon took the body and flew away. John could have covered the blood with the ashes around, said to the unsullied that their queen flew away and then he could have simply escaped.
The choosing of Bran as the new king also doesnt make any sense. He has no claim to the throne whatsoever. I highly doubt that any lord would accept him as the king, especially when there are Gendry who is the legitimized son of Robert Baratheon and John Snow, who is a Targaryen the rightful heir to the throne, that slew a Hitler wannabe. It was also surprising that no one brought up the ancestry of John Snow, but okay. It looks like they kinda forgot about it, just like they had forgotten about Euron's fleet. Btw. how the hell is Bran now suddenly okay with him being king.
It also doesn't make any sense that the lords would accept the North to be independent, when there is already the rightful heir of Winterfell appointed as king of the seven kingdoms. And what is it with all this that the North doesnt want to bow to anyone, when a STARK, I repeat, a STARK the rightful king of the North, is about to rule as king of the seven kingdoms. At that point all the other kingdoms could have also asked for independence.
It looks like everyone in GOT suddenly has Alzheimer's. Sam has forgotten that he is still in the Nights watch, they forgot about John's lineage, about Gendry's lineage and it also looked at the end, that they forgot about the mass murder that Daenerys commited as no one mentioned it in Johns defense.
There is much more that is wrong with this episode, or better to say with the whole season, but it would be too much to write about. I just have the feeling that the show needed another 2 seasons at least and some more polishing, so that things like bad tactics, the forgetfulness about a fleet and Tyrion suddenly becoming dumb wouldn't happen. It just feels rushed when it comes to the writing.",2,20 May 2019,7,11

You could come to accept the irrational and illogical demise of danni, with Cersei and her whole destiny ideology corrupting her and warping her sense of right and wrong. But for the lords to decide on Bran to lead? For what reason? Throughout earlier seasons he was hyped up to be a mystical creature who would tilt the favour towards the living, in the battle against the army of dead. Yet, he did nothing? He pointed out the dead army had broken the wall, which simple scouts could have spotted, as well Tourmund who witnessed it first hand. And then during the battle of Winterfell he sat in his chair and had a nap, there were multiple intense cinematic shots around Bran, combined with his ""I'm going now"" line to Theon, which made audience members believe he was going to actually do something useful for once, warp into a dragon, bring over Arya's Direwolf pack, but he didn't do anything. As well as this, he constantly pointed that he wasn't anyone anymore, wasn't a Lord, and lacked emotions for his friends and family - would that make him a good King? The writing was continuously poor and overall disappointing, while the acting, CGI and soundtracks were stunning. What a high level of post production, to such poor scripts.To conclude, everyone's favourite characters and plot developments were either forgotten or destroyed.

Next, Bran or should we say ""Bran the broken"", more like Bran the useless become king of the seven kingdoms without doing anything peculiar at all.

That doesn't mean I'm not happy for those who do like it, because I am happy for those who enjoyed every last minute of this final season. But for me, I expected something far greater than this. No, not all the silly and extremely far-fetched fan theories, but the same deep and twisted plot that we have grown so used to over the years. I'm not mad at Dany becoming the mad queen because I hoped this would happen. I'm not mad her death either. If anything, that is the one thing I DO enjoy because it was already shown to us in the visions she has way back in Season 2. Where she was about to touch the throne and then walked off into a place with Khal and her (unborn) son. This was a foreshadowing of her death right there and how she would join them in that moment. That reminded me of how complex and well thought out the show can really be. I'm mad at countless other plots just totally dropped, I'm mad at the character developments that suddenly made no sense. Tell me why was Jon brought back by the Lord of Light (another plot that abruptly ended) and why was his heritage of Targaryen so important in the end? It had no impact. (Varys was even shown writing countless letters about Jon being the true king but nothing came from that?). If you tell me it is to kill Dany then I will say that shows right there that the plot is not what it used to be. Countless of people could have pulled that off (Arya certainly could), Jon wasn't NEEDED for that. I'm not even going to mention how they needed 7 seasons to make 'winter come' only for him to be assassinated in 1 episode. I will also, for the sake of not writing an entire essay, even start about how certain character developments were butchered. I'm disappointed but I did enjoy these past years.

I have written a far better story here it goes..The plot started getting bleak in season 7 end when Daenerys went to king's landing to have a truce with Cersei instead she should have attacked kings landing and taken kings landing with Cersei pleading.. she should have made largest living army..Season 8 should have been all about fight between living and dead with greatest war anyone has ever seen..after winning the war Daenerys would have claimed winterfell and her dragons firing at Jon snow but Jon snow comes out of fire being a targareyn and kills Daenerys..all the people would have hailed Jon snow as he came out of fire and with support of north,wildlings and dothraki and would have been a strongest king ever lived in 7 kingdoms.",3,20 May 2019,2,2

I won't be buying any more Game of Thrones books if this is the plan for Daenerys. If this is basically what George R.R. Martin had planned, then I""m glad I know before I invest any more time reading.The ending with a free treasonous conversation with Jon Snow was pathetic. Like Dany after taking control would just let that conversation take place. All this time and she doesn't learn not to let her enemies spend time together? I don't buy it.This was fake drama at it's worse. It's too bad. This show had a lot of good years. The last few seasons not so good. This ending straight up awful and nonsensical. Just dramatic and ridiculous for the sake of drama and an attempt not to be predictable.I have no interest in the prequels now. I'll never buy this show. George better end the books better than this.

1552,"Game of thrones was a well thought out show. It has amazing development, causing you to fall in love with the characters and stories. It built tension and broke hearts. Then they all died.Unfortunately, no, they didn't actually die. They died in the writers room. All character development was out the window. All the build up, it was for a random ""surprising"" ending.
...except, the Weiss folks must have run out of ideas or out of money from HBO...then consulted with M Night Shyamalan for this, because they tried to do a twist ending that was absolutely stupid. Yikes. It was as if someone was making a fine, Craft Beer, then got tired, changed their mind, and tried to turn it into Bud Light.They called the cliche experts. They had to have. Because they forgot how to write dialogue and come up with good ideas for that. That was bad. It was really bad. Think: Spider Man 3. That is my movie comparison. Cliche, predictable, bad character writing, and unenjoyable to watch.Ok, also, what the heck was up with those lonnnnngggg drawn out scenes and lengthy clips of nothing??? This episode had an incredible amount of wasted screen time including: half-assed comedic dialogue, uneventful minutes of walking up stairs and stairs and stairs, long non-meaningful stares.Jon Snow. No resolve after killing Danny. Didn't even mention it. Never got a mention for the iron throne, even though 5 minutes before, everyone and their mother wanted him to rule.
Arya Stark. Flushed away her character. Faceless man? Not anymore, just a machine gun on the battle field who walks around like a whisper in the wind.
Sansa. Cool.
Danny. Blinded to her actions at a exaggerated degree. I can understand her burning the city. It was very Game of Thrones. But. We all know they needed 2-3 episodes to build up to that point (or an additional session).
Tyrion. Turned into a begging, broken, dwarf. His witty words were left in the crypt of Winterfell. Dead dialogue.
And Bran. Bran, Bran, Bran. He used the narrative of Aegon Targaryen, then seemed to have forgotten about it. Bran the Broken. Fitting for a broken ending.TLDR?: They killed everyone. Not on screen-in fact no one died, just some nobody-Lannister's -the writers killed them all on paper.

Game of thrones was about unexpected twists, thrilling off the edge drama and logical application to put things in the right perspective. Season 8 is not only a huge disappointment it's also a slap on the face of all those ardent followers of this show. Dave and Dan have showed us just how easily can such a magnanimous show be ruined just because of pathetic writing. The entire season seems so rushed into feels like they never wanted to make it in the first place.

I didn't believe I was seeing the exact same Game of Thrones that I loved and admired all these years.
Now don't let me start about the consequences of the murder. HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY JON's LIFE?? This is the character that bleed and won through all the wars, all the best part of the show. On top of that, he did everything for the peoples' interest. Even killing Dany was for the greater good of the people. Knowing that, this is their reward?? How on earth is that possible.

The characters means nothing to me, 2 seasons ago I was more invested in their story than my own. I couldn't care less about the winner because of the writing making them feel unnatural and like strangers, they could for all I know be faceless men in the shape of our heroes.I hope there's more to GoT.

Im not even mad just disappointed
Everyone kept telling me to wait until the end and every bizarre choice would be worth it

So the white walkers and the night king were completely useless to the whole plot of the show they werent even a plot device to reduce danys army since she magically revives most of it the next episode and in episode 5 shows that she barely needed an army to begin with. So you can take out the white walkers out of the whole show and nothing major would change they were mainly to this show what the island was to lost just a mystery to hook viewers that they had no idea how to solve by the end so they solve it in the most rushed and unsatisfying way possible you could have taken them out of the story and gave that time you sacrificed for them to the whole mad queen plot that was horribly underdeveloppedNext up is dany going nuts well i still dont buy it they slightly fixed it in this episode by making her look like this deluded ideologue but still after 7 seasons of being a rational person she just flipped a switch and became mad, i mean if you wanna say it was foreshadowed that itll happen sure you can indicate that events like burning the witch the slavers and the tarllys were indications of her madness but i can point to other characters that did worse things like arya actually killing freys and baking them into pies to feed to there own father before commiting genocide on a whole family with poison i mean thats concrete proof of hannibal lector psychotic behavior but sure dany is the ""mad"" one . ""But the freys killed her family "" youll say well the witch killed danys husband the slavers and masters had slaves and crucified children and well the tarllys were enemies of war, would tywin lannister have kept them alive if he was in danys place ? Was he ever considered mad ? No just a brutal politician. And speaking of tywin was he considered mad when he orchestrated the red wedding that led to god knows how many people getting butchered at a wedding and ending with a wolfs head on a beheaded rob stark ? "" but she has mad genes "" mad genes dont just magically activate with a flip of a switch even the mad king became mad after years of decline. I mean i dont mind the idea of the mad queen but it felt forced rushed and shallow watch breaking bad and see how they change the supposed hero into a mad maniacal tyrant and then tell me danys turn was satisfying i dare you.And finaly jon is just dumb, throughout this whole season he was dumb (he just had to tell the truth because he is good old honest abe althought his own father the most honorable man in all of westoros kept his secret for years and years but jon cant make it one day without holding it in because you know gotta be honest doyy) and in this episode he needed convincing that what his queen did was not right while using one of his two lines this entire season ""she muh queen"" im surprised he didnt tell her he was gonna stab her right before he did because you know you cant lie to someone youre about to kill jon thats just barbaric !The episode was fine i guess as fine as it can be with all that led up to it. Sansa's end was somewhat the most satisfying, we have democracy now so yey for that and the first democratic vote goes to a vegetable yey for that. What else .. oh and arya becomes columbus.So basically the season was really good from a visual spectacle perspective (the shot of the steps to the destroyed red keep with the giant targaryen flag is gorgeous) but really bad from a storytelling perspective especially for a show that was considered the greatest show ever but the last episode was just fine with pretty shallow and unsatisfying endings. I didnt even have any theories before this season (im a casual fan and this is my first review on anything) i just expected them after 2 years to do something truly worthy to be called the finale of the best show ever but it was a let down.

It no longer felt like Game of Thrones but an amateur writer's very first movie. The actors were given cheesy lines that weren't even true to their character. The Night King really was just gone like that? All those people died and Bran was needed for what? Just to be King? And Jon is exiled depsite that...meanwhile the Unsullied go free? Arya leaves despite her trying to get back to her family the entire series???

Just because he's a Targryen? I mean it doesn't matter if he killed his mom?Where the hell did Jon go in the end anyways?! Perhaps he went for a hike....Why would Bronn be the master of coin for Bran?! Wasn't he a greedy sell-sword? Bran should be aware that he's not worthy to be part of the council.If Jon really loves Danny to the final moment he wouldn't have sone it. I mean who kills their lover for the good of the realm? It needed more build up for this to make sense.The whole tunnels was totally intact while there was a pile of bricks just where Jamie and Cersei were standing.While Arya had an open wound, which means barely a couple of months passed after KL's being torched - and telling by the length of Jon's beards - they rebuilt the red keep to the full.

1635,"This wasn't even a bittersweet finale to a series, this was an oddly written tragic ending which prides itself more on subverting expectations much more so than satisfying the senses that make us enjoy a story in the first place.The most uninteresting character and the finest example of wasted potential on the entire series becomes king. The queen who we spent 70+ hours following her journey from a belittled non-entity to the beloved breaker of chains becomes ""mad"" largely over the course of 160 minutes and is then killed. The underdog of the series who becomes a true hero through his honorable actions rides off into the middle of nowhere which in his mind may be freedom but to the audience it is far from any sort of glory.Such a great example of wasted potential and it really missed the mark of wrapping up one of the best (unfinished) book to tv series of all time.My review is 4 stars because the cast did a phenomenal job acting with the material that they were given. The writing this whole season however was just so rushed and poorly executed that it continually pulled me out of the experience that was Game of Thrones. This finale was by far the finest example of that and unfortunately the final nail in the coffin.",4,20 May 2019,2,2

People more familiar with games might remember a similar disappointment at the end of Mass Effect 3, the difference being that the game is widely regarded as being great up until its final point. Game of Thrones suffered a more painful, slow decline as this season's episodes came out worse and worst, but the feeling is similar: all we invested ourselves in meant nothing at the end.The rules about how Westeros, its nobles and its kingdoms works were disregarded and broken, so were all character motivations established in the buildup to that point. This trend had already began in the last episode and only continued on. The slapstick humor and comic relief characters were plain bad and out of place for such a somber chapter.In the end, bad writing was the death of a great show. No complaints about direction, special effects and music, those were always great.

But the show is far beyond the books, without the main ingredient that made Game of Thrones epic - George R.R. Martin. So just took pleasure in the fact that we get to experience 2 different GoT stories... The 2nd story is ready when the books are complete :)But what I wasn't prepared for was this. It wasn't that it was bad, it's that they didn't even try. The ending was so aimless, so pointless and so unfulfilling it would have at least offered comical relief if the last scene was Eddard Stark waking up from a dream.Next time D&D - Please go read fan theories and steal their great ideas to improve your show, when you run of books to drain from. I'm not sure at what point, you two got it into your head that Game of Thrones was your creation, and tried to nurture the story to an end... You both, the actors and everyone else deserved better.

I don't care if Dany gets 'betrayed' as long as THE WRITING IS GOOD.The final battle should've been between the living and the dead. That is what this series has been building up to. I'd rather have the Night King win, than this ending. And maybe a sequel series about how Jon and Dany's kids (2 daughters, 1 son; the dragon has three heads) eventually destroy the Night King in a future battle for mankind down in Essos. With an army of (newborn) Dragon and Direwolves! After they've barely escaped fleeing from Westeros. Our heroes (Jon etc.) die saving those kids. THAT would be epic. And after Jon etc. die helping a few escape: his kids, maybe Tyrion, Davos. etc. along with dragon eggs and dire wolf pups, the Night King sees the ship sail away, walks towards the sea puts his hand in the water and the water slowly starts freezing. Andddd fade to black. THAT WOULD BE AN EPIC ENDING. Bitter sweet: everyone dies, even Drogon, but the three baby's barely survive escaping, and will eventually defeat the Night King (20 years later) in the FINAL battle for mankind riding three dragons, thus prophecy has come full circle!

1683,If I can give this a negative ten I would. They should've taken at least six more episodes to actually develop a story for season eight. Instead they crammed everything into five minute snippets. The majority of it had no logic behind it. The character arcs were also illogical and disappointing. Biggest waste of time ever. If you are a fan of the show watch episode five then instead of watching episode six just decide what would be your perfect ending and think of that instead.

Because Benioff and Weiss apparently thought that the GoT fan of the first hour would probably no longer be interested in sophisticated entertainment and the audience would suddenly consist of teenaged Twilight, Panem and Marvel fans only. Best evidence of who the creators wanted to make happy with the final season is the incredibly greasy scene in which Jon and Daenerys kiss and he thrusts the dagger into her heart. Just laughable!

Rewatchabilty has dropped unless you watch 7 seasons and then close your eyes and imagine an ending you want (You will come up with something much better i assure you)",3,20 May 2019,11,20

1719,"This entire season other than episode 3 has been extremely boring to start with. This was the worst series finale ever. All the sudden Jon decided to kill Dany because of a 5 min conversation with Tyrion? Why is he seen as a good guy remind me? He killed his queen, and barely anyone batted an eye. How did the unsullied and Dothraki not even go insane after the queen they have been following for years gets murdered? They are ok to kill former Lannister soldiers that have completely surrendered but not a queenslayer? It makes no sense. I never in a million years would have imagined to rate a GOT episode as a 1, by my gosh. This was terrible. Rotten garbage season with a rotten garbage ending.",1,20 May 2019,11,20

1721,"I have never seen such a terrible ending for a TV series. They didn't know how to end it and rushed the season destroying storylines and characters' development. In my opinion the biggest disaster was the way Daenerys died, begging for the love of Jon and wishing they could be a good couple, it's just not her. He could've killed her but she didn't need to look so pathetic in the moment of her death. After that, do you want me to believe that none of Dany's soldiers wouldn't kill Jon? They would simply let him free? C'mon it just doesn't make any sense. By the way where is Dany's army? They simply disappear. What is Bronn doing helping the king. How was tyrion still alive to give such a kitsch speech? Bran the king? I refuse to comment on that. There's a lot more of dumb stuff, but it doesn't matter, it is what it is and it's garbage.",1,20 May 2019,11,20

1732,"Warning SpoilersFirstly - I have absolutely loved this show all the way to the end but as such an invested viewer in the end there is so much missing and I think a lot of people will agree, this season was just completely rushed!
Because the season was rushed a lot of characters stories are left unfinished to an extent, or their story in the end made very little sense
Some decisions made in this season have left us disappointed in the way the end of this amazing story has been told
Being the last episode we expected much more than we gotWhat was the point of Jon being a Targaryen?
What was the point of all the training to become No One for Arya to just become a traveller?
Why was Danys character built up so well over all the seasons for her to become so crushed and mad so quickly?
What happened between Jon stabbing Dany & suddenly he is imprisioned and waiting to learn his fate?
Where did Drogon go?
What in the heck was with the build up of Jaime for his to die in Cersei's arms?I could go on forever but it won't get me anywhere!
Instead i will say - THANK YOU! Thank you to all the cast for their amazing performances and the way the all made us fall in love with the show and thank you for your dedication
Millions of GOT fans will miss you all dearly!",1,24 May 2019,14,27
1733,"Very disappointed that this episode is the fruit that bore from the last 10 years
Absolutely fails to fullfill the destinies of its larger to life characters. The biggest problem of this entire season has been the lack of direction from the course previous set by this show. I wish D&D an esrly retirement from their film writing careers",1,22 May 2019,14,27
1734,"D&D did an injustice to the amazing actors and rest of the crew that worked on this show. This show used to envoke emotion and creative discussion, but now I couldn't care less about the show. The ending and entirety of season 8 was inconsistent with the characters. Tension and foreshadowing that had been built up since season 1 was simply thrown away.There were so many ways that D&D could have ended the show that the audience would have been okay with that still would have been shocking and something we did not expect, but the writing seemed careless, rushed, and lazy. Very disappointing and sad. The writers should be ashamed of themselves.",2,22 May 2019,14,27
1735,"This was by far the most unsatisfying, worst and hilariously bad endings ever. The series was my favorit of all time. I have been watching this since the beginning and honestly even though the writers totally destroyed the series during this series it still is dead to me.For anyone who hasn't seen the finale stop reading now.
How the hell did the writers forget so many details from the series and even worse from the recent episodes. For starters Arya's skills of using other faces haven't been useful this season at all. Where were those? Secondly Bran had no use in the recent episodes whatsoever, he basically knew everything that was about to go down and kept his mouth shut during all of it. Only to later become the king of the six kingdoms. Third: how the hell was Jon Snows resurrection and for everyone knowing he's a targaryen when it came to no use whatsoever, instead he got sent to the night's watch because the unsullied were against him. The unskilled however, were sent to Naath so they wouldn't know anyway. Honestly all the scenes after Dany's death felt like a sitcom. It was so unserious and they sat there casually talking about who's gonna rule??? Furthermore how did all the dothraki even survive the war with the white walkers? We saw them die alongside the minority of the unsullied forces. The golden company were useless. Rhaegal was apparently too. But leave it to Drogon who just burns everything all three dragons couldn't before in just a few minutes. Personally I think that daenerys going mad wasn't TOTALLY out of the blue. Because we've seen that she's capable of doing really crazy things to her enemies for power, for the greater good without showing any kind of remorse. HOWEVER I do feel that they could've built it up much smoother and not the way they did. Where she just went full 360° turn and became totally insane and delusional over a fantasy world. There could've been so many better endings than the one we got. The characters fates were rushed and we couldn't even get a chance to connect to them. Honestly any other ending would have been fine except this one. I'm sorry. In my head it ended differently. I guess I'll continue reading the books to ease the disappointment. Otherwise the series was the best it's a shame they ruined it in the end.",1,22 May 2019,14,27

1737,"Before I begin, let me say that I actually really enjoyed parts of this final season. (Episode 2 and 3 were high points for me) That being said, the series finale was nothing short of terrible.I really don't get why they chose to rush the ending. They had the most popular show on television. Record-setting audiences. Why on earth would you choose to cut that short and cram everything into only six episodes?!This season would have been much better if they took 10 episodes to wrap it up, rather than 6. The story was simply too rushed. We jumped from three different villains in three consecutive episodes. Realistically, they could have written an entire season about the downfall of each villain (the Night King, then Cersei, then ultimately Dany). It would have been a great ending. Instead, they rushed to end one of the most popular shows in television history and completely tarnished its reputation in the process. Mind boggling.",1,22 May 2019,14,27

1741,"SPOILERS!!Positives: You can probably rewatch the series and this episode one day, it doesn't ruin everything the way that some other shows endings do.George R.R. MARTIN will one day finish the books and do the last few seasons better justice.The cinematography was fantastic. Dialogue was okay, acting was good. There are a few highlights (Tyrion's one liner about love; Drogon and Daenerys, the new council) Sansa's costume at the end; the mirroring of start and end with ghost and the wall).Negatives:Rushed. The last three episodes should have been at least one season. The moment between Drogon flying away and Tyrion opening his eyes should have been a series in itself. How all of those lord and ladies got to the meeting and what they each were to each other would have been fascinating to watch.Gaping loose ends at best or horrible plot holes at worst. Here are just some of the questions. PLEASE! If you think you can answer them, do!1) Hello Dothraki, I thought you all died in a suicidal charge which was dramatic, but incredibly poor tactics. You don't seem bothered about the battle with the Night King.2) Unsullied! Where did you all come from? And where are the other armies? Greyworm seems to have become heartless too - yet strangely not, after Jon kills Dany.3) So much fuss over who died in The Long Night and none at all here. No concern even. No time? Yet there is time for long, boring conversarions explaining the story rather than telling it.4) I thought the wall was broken?5) Are we still at King's Landing? It seems to have recovered remarkably quickly.6) Who follows Sansa in the North? Didn't they all swear to follow Bran?!7) If Bran sees all then doesn't that make him a pretty horrid conniving character? He doesn't lift a finger to save King's Landing - so no better that the others then.8) Oh look! Everyone is miraculously sitting together. How?9) Why didn't Danyrys, Greyworm or Drogon kill Jon?Argh. So many more.Better ways it could have ended?1) The Night King could have won. Or he could have been defeated at the cost of Jon and Daenerys's lives.2) Bran could have been going back in time during that battle to change the future/past.3) Jon could have won over the Dragon with his Targaryon-ness and flown away/killed Dany with it.4) Tyrion and Sansa could have married and ruled the kingdoms together.5) Arya could have married Gendry and taken the throne.6) The Golden Army could have done - anything! What was the point of them? Maybe a different love interest?So many more.",3,20 May 2019,14,27

We were promised a bittersweet ending, but this combined with the previous two episodes I can only describe Game of Throne's conclusion as sadistic and disappointing.And while we the viewers have been robbed of a decent ending, I can only truly imagine what it must have been like for the cast. The truth is, they acted their asses off. They did everything they could to sell this mess. They're the true victims of this disastrous finale.It felt like all of the pieces were there for the bittersweet ending we we promised, but somehow they couldn't fit together in the end. Jon saying good bye to his siblings would have made one cry had it been because they were all going their separate ways- had they been going where they truly belonged. Brienne writing about Jaime would have been heart wrenching had he died killing Cersei, not loving her. The small-council meeting would have been pure nostalgia had the tragic events of the episode not embittered it all, had the choice of small council members not been completely random. Sansa being named Queen in the North would have been epic, had she not morphed into a nearly unrecognizable character.Lastly, Jon and Daenerys....ice and fire....it's like the ice melted and embers of the fire went out. Our heroes met the most tragic ending I've ever seen. But the issue is not just tragedy, tragedy is to be expected when it comes to game of Thrones, it was how it was handled.

1811,"Guys, I understand the hate towards the 8th Season. I was furious too after what they did in the 5th Episode. Dany's character was completely ruined in that moment. It felt completely out of place and construed just for the shock factor.I didn't expect much from the ending but the last episode surprised me. It moved me. It is exactly the kind of ending anyone could have hoped for. Everyone finally got what they were meant to have.The writers cut a lot of corners and butchered quite a few characters to get there but I feel the ending kind of makes up for their blunders.Sure I would've preferred not to see so many characters being dumbed down, but this ending does not disappoint me either.",9,21 May 2019,16,32

Spoilers!The character arc of Daenerys was perfectly written and it made so much sense! In the end she died to what she always feared and intensely punished: betrayal. It was heartbreaking how Drogon pushed Daeny qith his nose, begging for a reaction. And the symbolism of burning the throne was just beautiful. In the end it was the endless desire of getting this throne which destroyed his mother.Jons fate was just beautiful and perfect. In S8E4 everyone was mad, because Jon didn't cuddle with Ghost. He decided in that moment to fulfill his duty rather than accepting his freedom for which Ghost is a symbol for. When he came back to the North in the last Episode he greeted his newly obtained freedom with a smile on his face. After all the horrible things he went through, although he actually never wanted any responsibilities, he could finally be free. As Tormund said: he belongs to the North.Yes the last season was smashed together. 2 more seasons would have enabled enough space for our emotions.

1850,"Are there worse television episodes out there? Without question. At it's absolute worst, Game of Thrones is still the pinnacle of production, set design, action sequences, acting talent and the like. Then we look at the writing.Where do you start with all the problems? Characters are either completely flanderised versions of themselves at best or have been thoroughly butchered into one dimensional plot devices that completely ruin any immersion you have left in the show. Watching their characters be broken down into husks is painful as a viewer, but I can't imagine what it has to be like for the actors who did an incredible job of portraying them and fleshing them out for us. I can't applaud them enough honestly for their work, and their efforts to salvage what was given to them.My main question is why would you build something with so much care, fill it with so much substance and style and then choose the rushed ending with seemingly no love for it anymore. Dan and Dave chose less episodes and less seasons despite being given a blank canvas to continue for as long as needed by HBO. Think of how grand and rich the world was back at the start. The realm was littered in small but important houses and characters, there were side stories and a mountain of political motive for all. Fast forward to the ending of the show and the world is barren. Small houses have been written out of the show and even the main houses we know by name are apparently just sitting empty. In the past we'd have been given a realistic depiction of all the power vacuums D&D have now forgotten or don't have the time to acknowledge now. Instead what we get is 9 main characters with plot armour deciding peacefully the rules and reality of the show no longer exist because they are the chosen winners.Deanery's dying after burning kings landing would have caused every person in the realm to go to war again for the title and power vacuum she left behind. But this is the end so it didn't happen. The complete antithesis of a decade worth of building up the nuance and teaching us the order of the universe we are enjoying.The painful part is that there are breadcrumbs of a good and bittersweet ending. Could I enjoy a story where Daenerys goes mad, Jon is forced to kill her and ends up living a new life in what used to be the lands of always winter? I absolutely could with a more coherent form of storytelling.I could write about it all for hours and have only touched on the surface of what I'd really like to discuss. This is the passion I and I'm sure many have had with this show. And for me, to have it descend into something completely unworthy of thought or reason is why it will be something I will describe as my biggest disappointment in television.",1,20 May 2019,9,16

1854,"There have been major parts of this series that were shocking, unexpected, and made me angry. But they made sense logically and plot-wise. The events that took place in Season 7 and 8, with bits and pieces in Season 5 and 6, does not make any sense. There was a lot of wasted time, wasted dialogue, and callbacks to make the viewers say ""hey, you 'member when Tyrion said that in Season 1?""D&D obviously do not understand the basics of feudal warfare. Trebuchets do not belong infront of infantry. Light cavalry are not meant to charge straight into the unknown. Castles are supposed to give soldiers a high advantage of defense.D&D forgot how feudal politics work. Giving Genry Storm's End gives a big contender to the Iron Throne more of a potential to contest Daenerys' claim. Genry should not propose to Arya for marriage. He should have spoke with Sansa and/or Jon to arrange it.D&D's writing became apparent that they write as if GoT took place in a modern western society.When they want something to happen, they just make it happen. Ballista and dragons are powerful when they want it to be, and weak when it suits them.Storywise, Sansa, Arya, and Varys were correct about Daenerys due to a lucky guess. But realistically, they were correct because the show-writers knew Daenerys would go from semi-questionable leader to she-Hitler in less than a minute. That's bad writing! Just as bad as having Arya and Sansa pretend they're fighting with each other on-camera, only to deceive the viewer to try and force a shock by executing Petyr Baelish, which I saw coming anyway. A character that would have had so many come-backs to the possibility of being put on trial for his crimes. Stupid writing.",1,20 May 2019,9,16

Does he too believe in that whole schtick about the WHEEL?!) the show just turned into a badly-written 80s sitcom. I can't put into words how bad this whole season was.

Ending the show in this surprising way, ""as death is the end for us all"" makes it perfect to end the series cause there is nothing more to be told after death.Winter Has Come - Judgment DayNote: Bran was the key (Giving him a purpose), so Night King won the ""Game"" back in Episode 3 as in this case Bran sees past,present and future, guiding Night King to victoryIn the end Cersei was the one who caused The Night King to win, had she not been so self centered and joined up forces instead.If you've come this far I appreciate you taking your time to read my fan made ending, hope you liked some of it :))",2,21 May 2019,15,30
1910,"Screw Benioff, Weiss.
8 years of wasting our passion.
The hell with you idiots who think they are even able to read and write.",1,21 May 2019,15,30
1911,"Why , it doesn't make senses she worked so hard to build an army to take her iron throne but guess what there are lucky people who don't do anything and get everything so sad about this and they should delete this episode",1,20 May 2019,15,30
1912,"To make a long story short....i have always said and believed Breaking Bad is the best TV series ever made ....now i am more certain than ever :
-this weird final meeting is ludicrous (what is samwell tarly doing there )
-They didn't even discuss Jon's heritage or patriot act
-even the dothraki and unsullied didn't really seem to care about their queen death (the one they followed thorugh their life and crossed contitnet for her)
-and why the hell bronn of blackwater which is the worst character in the show get all that ..what did he do ?
-why the wiliding is still in the north ,,they were gone i suppose ...
i can go on forever this is embarrassing",1,20 May 2019,15,30
1913,The worst episode i have ever seen. All the leaked news were true,1,20 May 2019,15,30
1914,"Unbearable at times, you just want it to finish as early as possible.Missed opportunity, for sure. They just didn't hit the right notes. Storyline was flat and just breaks the heart of every GOT fan.",3,20 May 2019,15,30
1916,"The amount of negative reviews and ratings is just ridiculous, but after seeing how this whole season was viewed, it was completely expected. I sincerely think people are mad because they just didn't get what they wanted, and also they THINK that most things don't make sense, but they do, they truly do.
All you have to do is pay attention, sure there may be some mistakes, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this ending is the one that made the most sense, considering all the events that led to that very moment. Not every prophecy has to be fullfiled, not every fact or event has to be fully developed
and resolved, not everything has to work out in the way we intend to. Events can certainly have different outcomes, and not everything has to be satisfying.
Some things happen, some things don't. Some things make it to the very end, some things end up halfway, and that's just how it works.From the moment Dany decided to burn King's Landing and its people to the ground, it all went straight to hell, is the event that triggered all that happened
in the finale. Everyone except her armies saw her as an unjust, unfit ruler, who was capable of causing even more damage to all the people in Westeros. So
Tyrion's plan was to get rid of her in order to avoid the worst. It was logical that Jon be the one to do it, for many reasons. He received his punishment, and
on top of that, he's going to have to live all of his life tortured with what he did, always wondering if it was right, considering how noble he is. If he hadn't
suffered any consequences it wouldn't be realistic, he made a sacrifice, so he had to pay the price. Grey Worm or the Unsullied could only capture him, not
kill him because that would have started a war between them and the men of the North. I believe Drogon didn't burn him to death because he knows he is a Targaryen, and probably knows he is the last of the Targaryens as well, so Drogon burned the Iron Throne instead, took Dany's body and left.In my opinion, two of the episodes main points, Dany being killed and Bran becoming king, can be explained by two scenes prior to those aforementioned
moments and the two involve Tyrion: the scene where he and Jon have a conversation and where he gives the speech about why Bran is the best option.
I bet a lot of people saw the leaks in reddit and immediately thought ""Bran king? wtf!"" or some stupid reaction like that, without even considering how it
would play out in the actual episode. It all makes sense. Bran had a higher purpose and he knew it. Most people spoke too son, everyone complained about Jon not saying goodbye to Ghost in ep 4, but now we know they would meet again and have a proper farewell.It's all there in the show, the reasons why characters act the way they act, their motives, actions, reactions. It's all in the dialogue, it's all in the events that
unfold, sometimes it's direct and sometimes indirect. You have to put the pieces together, GoT is not a simple show. For a lot of things people complain about the answer is right there waiting for them, you have to use your brain to connect the dots to make sense of it, it's not that hard. Put some thought into it, analyze every moment, don't just think things and say things that you saw other people say and repeat. Not everything has to be the way you want to
or the way you think it should have happened. I get it, there could have been more development for Dany's storyline, more moments that would indicate that her descent from liberating slaves to burning innocent people was imminent so it doesn't feel forced and rushed. Season 7 and 8 should have had more episodes so the all the way transited right up to the end would have left the majority of people satisfied. I disliked some plot points made in all previous
episodes, but I understood why those points needed to happen, in order to set events in motion for the end to be understandable and coherent.The 1s people are rating this episode with are absurd, they are being so exaggerated and overly dramatic. I can happily say I enjoyed the episode, and
glad I was not disappointed, like I thought I would be. A just and fitting ending for what is my favourite TV show of all time. Thank you GoT, cast and crew.",8,20 May 2019,27,60
1917,"I realize I am in the minority but I was absolutely satisfied with the ending. I've read the books and followed the show since day one before anyone says I'm not a ""true fan"" and I felt it was well done. I feel like all the haters would have hated ANY ending that was given. I will admit being slightly disappointed in Jon but then he redeemed himself completely IMO.",10,20 May 2019,370,1031
1920,"A lot of people do not like the ending because of the death of Daenerys. But, if there is one thing we have learned from this series is, that ""what is dead may never die"", as John Snow was raised from the dead, the dragon flew away with the body of Daenerys. That dragon is born and bred in Dorne, and the priestess of the Lord of Light, also originate from Dorne. It's very likely the dragon has Daenerys raised from the dead by such a priestess.
This episode asks for a sequel.",9,23 January 2021,17,35
1921,"If you paid attention to the characters, you would have seen this ending.
Dany was always going to be mad. She said it over and over. She would take what is hers by right with fire and blood. She did just that.
Jon never wanted to be king. He didn't want to be lord commander, he didn't want to be king of the north and he didn't want to rule Westeros. He was always going to be happiest with the free folk beyond the wall. That is where he belonged.
Sansa wanted Winterfell. She wanted to be queen. It's what she felt she deserved.
Arya is an explorer. She doesn't belong anywhere. The only thing she cared about was revenge for her family. Now she can go off in peace.
Bran...what can I say about bran... I've always loved his story line and I always knew he had big plans. He's the perfect person to rule.Anyone would doesn't like the ending hasn't paid enough attention to the characters. I've watched the entire series 5 times and every time I watch it I catch something new. I've also read the books. You wouldn't be disappointed if you would pay attention! It never was going to be Jon or Dany on the throne. Ever!!!",10,20 May 2019,53,129
1922,This is the worst finale ever that I could even imagine. Very disappointed.,1,22 May 2019,12,23
1923,I wish I could vote 0/10 because this last episode is the worst creation in our modern entertainment industry ! The work that was put in this season ending is absolutely shameful and not to up to par with current entertainment industry standards !,1,22 May 2019,12,23
1924,"I waited 8 years for this? I dont even feel any emotion about what happen. They should have added more episodes so it wouldnt feel so rushed. Maybe 2 more episodes of battle against the dead, and 1 more episode about Dany's rage. Jon wouldnt kill her only because Tyrion tells him what will happen. He's too loyal to do that. Maybe Dany will sail to Dorne or winterfel (like she said) and do some damages there and that's when Jon decided to kill her. It makes more sense. And then maybe 1 last episode to show the impact of Dany's death and the need to choose another leader.Also, the author should have finished the book, what took him so long? 1st book was written ages ago.",1,22 May 2019,12,23
1925,I can't state my disappointment any better than the twenty or so reviews I've read before writing this. I was in denial for so long this season thinking it wouldn't be as bad as it seemed. It was. We were robbed.,1,21 May 2019,12,23
1926,How can you destroy something that was so good is beyond awful!,1,21 May 2019,12,23
1927,Such a bad bad ending for my favourite tv show. been a loyal supporter since season 1-7 and season 8 is just abysmal. i really hope they can fix their mistake and redo this season 8.,1,21 May 2019,12,23

1929,"Wtf was that? In all honesty, what was the point in all the character build ups if in the end it's just for pure fanservice. Fairytale Disney ending for all the starks, if your surname isn't stark you're going to get killed because your plot armour isn't thick enough. How is this a bittersweet ending? D&D , do everyone a favour and never write again. Season 8 should have been a beautiful ending to a beautiful show with amazing battles but what do we get? Fan fiction. No disrespect to the actors and production crew because they did amazing, they were all great. Shame the writing was a complete let down and all those efforts from those mentioned before was put to waste. In the nicest way possible, f you D&D, ruined our beautiful show",1,20 May 2019,12,23
1930,"The ending was so amazing that I m planning to rewatch it again and again.. This season was such a masterpiece, Thank you D&D for everything, for this disappointment, I am SPEECHLESS",1,20 May 2019,12,23
1931,Well that was a waste of time and a big disappointment. Will never ever watch anything that D&D is involved with. Real fans of scifi/fantasy want story as number one not big explosions and fancy cgi. Sad when pop culture took over the genres star trek dead star wars dead marvel dead doctor who dead batman dead superman dead and now game of thrones dead.,1,20 May 2019,12,23
1932,"Bran, who basically did nothing the entire season, becomes king?
Death of Dany also rushed and disappointing just like that of Cersei and Jamie.

Hats off to the acting, But What was the point of Jon being a Targerian?",1,20 May 2019,12,23
1934,"Worst finale. I wish they have kill Jon Snow when he stabbed from hearth, that ending would be better for him than that. This show didn't deserve this ending. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are the worst scenarist ever. They couldn't do anythibg without George R.R. Martin. I'm going to wait the books to be published, so I can read a good story. Worst than Lost finale. Very very dissapointing, I'm really angry.",1,20 May 2019,12,23
1935,"What a steaming pile of snowflakery. All hail the cripple he cannot have a heir, cripple from root and stem, paralyzed. Dreamt his way onto the throne, and called this fantasy the broken king, it was written by a different author. Because the lords of the magna carta decided to nominate mental health as a knighthood for all aspiring climbers with ptsd. The unsullied became slaves again, as the freefolk got banished. And even the icewall got repaired .Lame, literally. Worst. If that was the best fanfiction has to offer. The books are doomed.",1,20 May 2019,19,40
1936,"It's funny to see some of people coming intentionally to give 1 star and we all know it doesn't deserve 1 star..The season was bit rushed but doesn't mean this was never going to happen and after George confirming his book ending will be same as show one...It proved it's all written especially about dany fate through house of undying...This episode still deserves minimum 6 star because of great acting, nice ending , music and good direction giving 1 starts shows people immaturity.",10,20 May 2019,40,95
1937,"I would try not to harm any opinions. I enjoyed the Show FULLSTOP. Since I was a kind, grandmother thought me:"" If you don't like something, avoid it - otherwise negative emotions you spread would return to you."" I tried to read very calmly those who gave 1-2-3 stars....very aggressive, very angry...I would avoid to comment on that.
All I would like to say to whole team who made the Show - Thank you.",10,20 May 2019,37,87
1938,"You invest so much into a series, especially when you see a build up so strong. If the actors feel that the reviews and petitions are an insult to the writers, what about the viewers who spend time increasing the revenue season after season? Disappointed.",1,22 May 2019,14,28

terrible writing
lazy writing",1,24 December 2020,8,14
1944,The most epic and wonderfully-told tale of brilliant plot twists and legendary character arcs ends with the jaw-droppingly deflating conclusion that Bran ascends the iron throne.

1948,"I saw soaps with more logic, like how dumb do they think we are?
I never thought an episode could destroy a show specially the best show of the decade but this one did. Way to sink the show's rewatch value, most of the main's arcs didn't amount to anything save Tyrion (the wost advisor in history) and Sansa
The acting, music and visuals were great though",1,25 May 2019,8,14

All character development, all plot line, gone. For what? To surprise us? Well that sure did give the fandom surprising disappointment. I wish they remake this season cause I'm just heartbroken to see the biggest show in the world to end like this.",1,21 May 2019,8,14

1953,"After years of prophecies and forshadowing, I thought the stories would finally intertwine to give us the ending we deserve. What we got instead, was poor writing, a broken narrative and a wreckage of character development. Well done D&D for turning one of the best shows of all time into a joke.",1,21 May 2019,8,14
1954,That even the red woman thought its better to commit suicide,1,21 May 2019,8,14
1955,"After some thought, I think the endgame of most of the character stories COULD have made sense.The real problem is the (lack of) buildup to all of the character conclusions. Also, the episode itself is (AGAIN) full of plot holes and inconsistency. Let's look at each of the main characters in turn:Danaerys. This is what mostly ruined the ending. There were no signs of any 'madness' before her sudden turn to torch the city last episode. Yes, she made threats but never suggested anything that would hint she would go on to kill thousands of civilians. For everyone she executed, she had good reason. And so, her death feels meaningless because her character was not believable any more. We either needed more time to appreciate her transformation into this evil villain or they should have started her turn a lot earlier than Episode 4/6 in the Final Season!Because Danaery's turn seems so unrealistic, everything else feels empty because her sudden turn to madness is central to everyone else's plot.Jon had to kill her, no doubt. But I did not feel anything in that moment. It was expected but I did not know who Danaerys was anymore, she certainly wasn't the person I watched grow over the past 7 years. If you can't understand a character, their death will have no impact and that's exactly what happened here.This brings me to Jon Snow. There is nothing special about his character that meant it had to be him to kill Danaerys. Arya could have easily done it or Tyrion, Davos, Varys etc. It doesn't make sense to resurrect Jon for this reason. It's poetic since they were lovers but that's about it. It was always hinted that Jon had a greater purpose - to destroy the Night King. He fought him beyond the wall, they knew each other. It seemed like they had some kind of deeper connection. Arya killing the Night King felt cheap and unwarranted. Jon has just become a puppet, being used and pulled by everyone with no will of his own anymore. He even had to be manipulated by Tyrion to kill Dany.Jon is sentenced to go back to the Night's Watch for killing Dany - here is the episode's biggest inconsistency. I don't understand why GreyWorm didn't execute Jon and Tyrion after they betrayed and killed his Queen. Grey-Worm was fiercely loyal and was seen butchering Lannisters at the start of the episode because he is getting rid of 'all enemies of Danaerys'. He would of course killed Jon and Tyrion instead of holding them hostage until foreign rulers arrived! Also, the Unsullied and Dothraki have no Leader, no allegiances to any other Ruler and their late Queen just declared war on the remaining 6 Kingdoms. So how are all these Leaders sitting and laughing in King's Landing as a council? It made no sense.Also, why sentence Jon back to an organisation that has no purpose? The Night's Watch was meant to keep out the Wildlings and any other supernatural threat. The Wildlings are living inside the wall and the Night King is dead. Bran should have explained why we still needed the wall. I am therefore not ok with how this played out.Bran's appointment felt strange to me. He's not in touch with his human side, why would he make a good ruler? His monotone voice and clinical language will draw no inspiration from the people or the armies. He has no charisma and has never been a Leader. However, Bran would be a perfect member of the council instead and with his unlimited knowledge, he would make an invaluable adviser to any King or Queen. I am not comfortable with him as King but meh, I can live with it.Arya travels to see what is 'West of Westeros'. This was foreshadowed, she had no desire to be a 'Lady' and became completely independent.. She had shown this traveler's curiosity before so I'm OK with this.Sansa rules the North, which is expected but I came to dislike her character the most (not sure if she's supposed to be hated or not). She basically plotted against Danaerys and betrayed Jon's trust to get Jon on the throne and is the main reason for the chaos in Kings Landing. She is the show's last biggest game player but she wins and is rewarded with her own Kingdom, separate from the rest. However, I think this selfishness would cause the other Rulers to want separation too? (especially Yara, who supported Dany) So I'm not sure how she got away with this.Tyrion has been the most consistent character. Sure, his charm, wit and intelligence have suffered the past few seasons but there were no books to draw from. His motives were always clear, to see a fair ruler on the Iron Throne.Bronne ends up on the council. A lowlife sell-sword whose loyalty switches like the wind. He talks of rebuilding brothels and is appointed Master of Coin. I didn't like this at all and Tyrion should have known better than to have a man like that in a position of influence. I thought we were building a better world?Drogon destroys the Throne and ignores Jon because ( I presume) Jon is a Targaeryan and dragons don't target them? Anyways this is supposed to symbolize a new beginning, yet we still have a Dictator (King Bran) so this doesn't quite add up either.In summary, the endings of the characters COULD have worked with further explanation and build-up. They made HUGE mistakes with Danaerys & Jon's character. There are too many plot holes and inconsistencies throughout the last few seasons to be ignored and ultimately we end up with an unsatisfying Finale.I view this series in two parts. Season 1-5 (mostly following the books) and Seasons 6-8 (show writers attempt).You have to view the last few seasons with lower expectations because there is no rich source material to adapt from. They went for action at the cost of story and they could have gotten away with it if they had just been more careful. However, characters were unfairly destroyed (Dany, Jon, Jaime) for shock value and logic went out the window (just like Tommen did) for a lot of scenes. The quality in writing dropped too far and the whole story was damaged as a result.It's a sad end to what could have been an epic masterpiece (up there with Lord of the Rings) and could have been watched by many future generations.But how can you re-watch the series when you know half of the early character development and foreshadowing doesn't amount to anything?All in all, it's been a great ride and I have witnessed some memorable moments, fantastic cinematography and incredible acting. But now, my Brothers and Sisters, my watch has ended and it's time to move on.",4,21 May 2019,8,14
1956,WHERE IS ELLARIA SANDWorst ending in history. We'll watch a bad movie.They're an insult to the books.and. WHERE IS ELLARIA SAND,1,21 May 2019,8,14
1957,"There are a plethora of plot holes in this extremely rushed season that were never and will never be addressed. The previous seasons were all exceptional, albeit with their own flaws but this culmination of the story felt like a huge disappointment. As usual the visuals and soundtrack were incredible.",3,21 May 2019,8,14
1958,"The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the efforts of the amazing cast and crew. The cinematography, the VFX, the set pieces, and the acting (Emilia Clarke outdid herself this season), were all brilliant. Issue was, the entire episode I was too busy losing my head over the appalling writing to truly appreciate what the cast and crew had achieved.
There's a lot too say about how rushed the ending was and how incoherent the narrative was. There's a lot to say about how the writers butchered the development of characters and their story arcs. I just want to focus on some in-world plot holes that I can't get my head around.
1. The Dothraki are known for their violent and barbaric nature. Are we supposed to assume that after sailing all the way to Westeros with the promise of rewards, they just kindly left after their Queen was murdered without causing an uproar?
2. With the death of Dany, the destruction of major houses such as the Freys, Tyrells, and Lannisters (excluding Tyrion), an enormous power vacuum now exists. Are we to accept that none of the lords and nobles began fighting for that power? Instead, they just elected a crippled nobody (to the viewers, he is Bran, but how many of those lords and nobles know him other than ""son of Ned Stark""?). Sure, that's how lords and nobles have worked in history. No greed or hunger for power. Just unwavering trust in a no one.
3. The North gains independence, but no one else? Dorne, that has always been known for its rebellious nature, just agrees to stay within the Seven (now six) kingdoms? The Iron Islands? Nope? No one says ""hey, if the North gets independence, so do we""? Nice. Makes sense.
4. The Northmen are known for their loyal and honourable nature. Are you to tell me that they just sat by as their King, Jon, was exiled? No outcry, no retaliation, they just move on and got a new ruler, Sansa. Speaking of which, why was Jon exiled, exactly? Jon could have been brought back once the Unsullied left, and they would have never known.
5. The new Small council makes no sense. Sam hasn't forged a full chain and yet he is Grand Maester. He has also broken his vow of celibacy by not only doing it with a girl, but impregnating her. Why is Bronn there when he is known for his dishonest nature? And Brienne? Isn't she sworn to Sansa?
6. The Unsullied murdered innocent women and children, yet they didn't kill Jon the moment after he stabbed Dany. They just arrested him and even opened up talks with lords and nobles regarding his fate. For an army that is supposedly so loyal to their Queen, they really let her murderer off.I could keep going on, but I'll stop. You get the point. Thanks D&D, for allowing hubris to be your downfall. R.I.P GoT. May Martin save us all.",3,21 May 2019,8,14
1959,Such a bad ending for a great show! Everything was done so fast that it made it look like they did not have time at all!The last scene where everyone goes back to where they belong or what they want to do says that there should be a 9th or even 10th season!,2,21 May 2019,8,14

IF ONLY that king's election scene made sense. Bran the most useless THING becomes king just because Tryion says so!!

1981,"The whole thing is stupid. The near decimated unsullied and dothraki suddenly multiplied to the point of thousands. When at most there is only 100-200 of them at episode 5. We can't fight the unsullied, why not? There is only 100 of them, just kill them and rescue jon.
Grey worm: the city is ours. Next scene: we sail for naath. Like the unsullied would know if jon is king or not. Which shouldn't be a problem in the first place cause the unsullied and dothraki are just way outnumbered by the westerosi by this point.
Sansa: north is independent, deal with it. Bran: sure sis. So the other lords don't wanna declare independence too? Logic. I got no problem with bran being king. But the whole independence thing is just plain stupid and illogical. Why the rest of them want bran as king? It's clear edmure wants to be one. Why not become independent as well? What bran gonna stop you? He just gave his sister independence.Only reason for 2/10 and not 1/10 - is the Drogon scene.",2,20 May 2019,8,14
1982,"I don't hate the ending because I was hoping for something else, but because this ending lacks logic, has a lot of plot holes, and contradictions.The last 2 seasons didn't appear to be part of the same story, but a joke. I would not even start complaining about the main illogical problems from the last season: killing the knight king by Arya's teleportation or Rhaegal death etc.So the ending of GOT:
I don't understand Bran's story and how he managed to be the king. In the last seasons... Bran acts like a zombie: he said he doesn't leave in the present anymore and can't be lord of Winterfell ( because he is the 3 eyed Revan)... but 2 seasons later he can be the king of the six kingdoms. Even more, as the 3 eyed raven doesn't he live more than an average person? As I remember the last 3 eyed Revan lived for more than 1000 years. Does anything of this make sense for you?Also, I found it interesting that all/most of the main characters are dead or had a tragic ending, after all their sacrifices and struggles. But the secondary/ supporting characters have a happy ending, even though most of them didn't do much for it, they were just there...
The writers were like: ""let's make a shock factor by ruining all the main characters, but give the happy ending through the other ... so fans will be satisfied ""I can't say I am disappointed, because that would mean that I just expected more and the last season was decent (it wasn't decent, so I am disgusted).",1,20 May 2019,8,14
1984,"I was a GoT fan from the moment I saw the trailer for season 1. Following the end of season 1 I read all of the books as i simply could not wait for season 2 to begin.I have been an avid fan ever since spreading the word to anyone who will listen to me of what a cleverly written unpredictable and at many times ruthless show it is. I encourage people even further to read the books and you do not want to know how much money i have spent on merchandise over the years.I've just finished the finale and am truly crushed at the weakness of this. I do not feel that closure has been brought to any of the storylines whatsoever. I feel like ripping down my posters and burning them. I am selling my box sets (I had planned on buying the full set once it had completed) and I am currently half way through re reading the 4th book and im simply going to delete them from my kindle.George r r Martin you started something which you did not finish. You as a writer owed your fans something for their loyalty to you prior to you finding tv fame. You have given NOTHING back to your fans and have repayed 8years (longer than that for many book fans as the first book was published in 1996) of loyalty with contempt. Fitting considering that's how Dany (our hero throughout the whole series) is treated also. Like a foot note to the series as tho she was never important at all. Couldn't so much as give us closure on where her body was laid to rest and what became of drogon (although bran hints like we will see but then we never do).The final episode is 1 hour and 15 mins and honestly they could have shortened it to 15 mins as the rest was simply ego stroking. Well done George, your life's work has ended in the biggest flop in history, congratulations! You've disappointed millions globally simultaneously. Thats got to get him in the record books for sure.

Last week I was enjoying the show, not everyone was I get that; I thought last week was ok.Flash forward a week and I'm numb. Numb because the show I have loved and adored for the past 8 years had the most flat, disappointing and nonsensical finale I've ever seen.I always guessed Jon was going to be the one to kill Dany. It just made sense because of his true identity being such a threat to her - and whilst many are disappointed by the scene where he kills her, I did think it was done with respect to the internal turmoil that Jon is going through. He didn't want the throne but knew Dany wasn't the right person to lead. What I didn't expect was the Unsullied to suddenly grow a pair, and hold him prisoner when they have no ruler! And not just that but not accept the actual true residents of Westeros wanting to show mercy!Now there are going to be those that defend Dany and I get that this series rushed her story. However the last 3 to 4 seasons has always hinted at her descent into 'Mad Queen'. If you rewatch you'll see lots of hints (too many to mention here) but The House of the Undying is a good prophecy now we know the end of the show!The biggest disappointment for me wasn't Sansa reclaiming the North - let's face it that was on the cards for a long time! Instead I found myself wanting to scream and cry at Bran the Broken! I'll admit I was one of those that had hoped Jon would take his rightful place in the Iron Throne, and yes I was upset that didn't happen, but maybe I would have been less upset if Tyrion or Sansa or someone who's character had developed more than just into an emotionless shell ended up on the throne.Arya sailing West was just completely out of left field. Never saw that coming! And Bronn as Master of Coin?? Please!!!I am left wanting more and my rating is because the cast and crew worked so hard to bring something so amazing to the screen. Despite its fairly lacklustre finale, GoT has been an epic masterpiece with outstanding acting, special effects, and for the most part great storylines and characters. I will certainly miss my weekly fix of Thrones.My only hope now is that when GRRM releases the final books that the ending isn't that portrayed in the show but one that the story truly deserves!!",4,20 May 2019,8,14

D&D just lost every asset they had with most of their fans.

Cast and Crew, you all performed your roles and jobs with outstanding reverence for your trade under horrible writers. Please understand the outrage is toward ""Dan, Dave and the Production Company"" for allowing such obvious horrible writing to destroy character arc's, development and plots that have taken years to build up.Instead of properly doing things this last season was extremely rushed and more comic than dramatic because of it. Two more season could have flushed out those plot-points and character arc. This would have possibly allowed for the Great Ending this show's Cast, Crew and Fans deserved.",1,21 May 2019,20,43
2050,"At first I was super disappointed in the ending. I understood how people who didn't anticipate Dany going dark felt during her genocide. Jon's ending was really a gut punch that left in a state of total disbelief.But after having cooled down and pondered, I came to realize the show did deliver the bittersweet ending they promised.Let me get this out first: I agree that they rushed the story unnecessarily. They should have done two seasons, one following the battle against the dead and one following Dany's transformation into a tyrant.But, in what regards the character's endings, I now believe it was the right thing to do.Dany's death was beautifully handled. It couldn't have happened any other way than Jon killing her after realizing that she is too far gone in her own mesianic dellusions. She wanted to make the world a better place and still believed she would until the very end, which is heartbreaking to see. Drogon trying to wake her up really got me teary eyed. And him burning down the throne is very poetic, he realized that the true corrupting element was that throne (much like the precious ring in LOTR) . A dragon forged the throne, a dragon brought it down. Also, that scene of him picking his mother up and carrying her to what I hope is Valyria, their home, is hauntingly beautiful. Dany was never really welcomed in Westeros so she shouldn't have ended up there.Bran being king makes sense in the end. He was the first point of view character in the books so it's a full circle with him on the throne. Also, Tyrion's line that Bran has the best story shouldn't be interpreted as just referring only to Bran's personal story. I think what he truly meant is that Bran has the complete story of everyone and everything. So, who better to rule than someby who has seen it and knows it all?Tyrion ended up what he was always meant to be. The hand. A wise advisor who has the people's best interests at heart. He was never going to be king, he was always going to be despised by the smallfolk because of his dwarfism. Sure, Tyrion made a huge mistake supporting Daenerys, but there are only a few people who weren't mesmerized by her. He now has the chance to make ammends and do right by the people.At first, I was annoyed by Sansa insisting on the North being free. But then I understood she didn't do it for herself, she would have been fine with being wardeness of the North and bowing to Bran. But what would have happened after Bran's dominion had come to an end? She had no control of would be elected king at that point so she did what was right by the future generations of her people.Arya was never going to settle down and be a lady. That's not her. So setting off into the sunset, becoming a wanderere, is the best thing that could have happened for her.Jaime got his honourable ending when Brienne listed all of his good deeds in that book of knights. And she got her good ending by becoming Kingsguard to the king acknowledged by everyone.Jon. Finally Jon. I was angry and disappointed at first. But then I came to understand that it was right for him in the end.He really was the Prince that was promised, albeit tragic prince. He saved the wildlings by sacrificing himself. He gathered the armies against the dead by sacrificing his crown as the King in the North. He saved Westeros by sacrificing his love. He brought the light and the hope after the terror that Dany had instilled with her athrocity. He brought deliveranceHe always liked living with the freefolk, he even told Tormund he would have rather gone with them north, instead of south with Dany.And I think Bran knew this so by sending him to the wall, he saved his life and gave him a chance to go North and really be free among the freefolk, far from any duty, pledge and obligations. Jon has always been defined by other: bastard, steward, crow, lord commander, king in the north, true heir, etc. Him going North is the first truly free choice he makes. And he seems happy about it, as happy as he can be while knowing that he had betrayed both of the women he loved in the name of what he deemed (and we alongside him) as the greater good.And in the end, even Dany's dream of breaking the wheel came true, so, in a very poetic and tragic way, her death fulfilled her purpose.This, I think, truly is the bittersweet ending that was always promised.",10,21 May 2019,20,43
2051,So angry right now. 8 years for nothing. This is just so embarrassingly bad,1,20 May 2019,16,33
2052,"First of all, I must say it's quite a cliché ending for a story like this. George's books might have similar character endings but the road there will make more sense. R+L=J is apparently completely meaningless, and exists just there to lead to Dany's demise, at least Jon got to unite with Ghost in the end. Visuals of the episode were great, many striking and iconic shots. After the fifth season I learn't that you just have to forget logic when watching this show these days. I think Bran being the king is eh... passable, but I think they made him the king just for him to have some purpose after the depressing way of how the show runners handled the white walker threat that was hyped up for 8 seasons. I liked many of the minor details such as the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" book, Brienne writing Jaime's deeds in the Kingsguard book, Tyrion re-arranging the chairs, Drogon flying off with Dany's body though it's kind of weird that Drogon didn't seem to be angry at Jon for killing her mother. I like how the last shot reflected the first ever shot of the show. What are the Dothraki going to do now? Good luck on the Unsullied going to Naath, they're just sailing to their deaths, for casuals, only natives can live on Naath. Daenarys's dialogue was kind of cringe-worthy and Emilia Clarke's acting was wooden as ever. Performances of Dinklage, Maisie, Kit Harrington and Edmure's actor were great. Edmure scene was actually funny. Soundtrack was pretty good, but not the best we've heard from Djawadi. One right decision that D&D did,turning off their phones and getting drunk for how they executed season 8 LMAO",6,20 May 2019,18,38
2053,"After seeing this underwhelming final episode, I can say with certainty that this series consists of two parts which must be judged separately.The first part consists of season 1-5 and is a book adaption. This part is amazing and easily my favourite series of all time. All the best and most dramatic moments of Game of Thrones (in my opinion) are in this part: Ned's death, the Red wedding, Tyrion confronting and killing his dad, the fight between Oberyn and the Mountain, etc. The story telling, the acting, the drama, the cinematography were all brilliant. I rate it 10/10.The second part consists of season 6-8. It is the show runners' attempt to continue the story where the books left off. Unfortunately, the show took a big dive almost immediately after they ""ran out of books"", then deteriorated further in season 7 and finally fell apart completely in season 8. The problems with the writing were manifold. Dialogues felt out of character. The pacing was off, either dragging things out too long or rushing and skipping over things. There were inconsistencies with the time/place that characters were supposed to be at. Logic out of the window. Lots and lots of plot-armor. Most of all, the writers just didn't know what to do with these great characters they had. For example, Arya with her special skills was completely underused in the final two seasons. Many events in season 7 and especially 8 felt arbitrary, unbelievable or outright silly. I rate this part 6/10.The conclusion of season 8 was particularly problematic. It hinged on two main developments that led to the outcome that we saw. The first one is Daenerys becoming the Mad Queen, the second one is Jon turning against her. Unfortunately, both of these developments were unconvincing and felt forced. We just didn't buy it from these characters after the development that they went through during the previous seasons. Finally, Bran on the throne felt inconsistent with his character development as well and even went completely against his own words in an earlier episode when he said ""I can never be lord of anything"".It is sad and disappointing that it had to end this way. But overall it's still an amazing show. It has been quite a journey during the last 8 years and one that I wouldn't want to have missed out on. The seasons 1-5 will be held up as one of the greatest achievements in TV production of our age.",4,22 May 2019,11,21

What qualifications does he have to throw the breastpin of hand of the Queen in front of Dany? Without Dany he is nothing, he just is an escaped prisoner captured by Cersei. It's Dany gave him power and glory, named him as her hand of the Queen. What has he done? Did he do something to help Dany? He do nothing! He just talking and do nothing. He failed Dany over and over times. He is the reason why Dany is killed. He is the murder too. Now he still is the hand of king, the hand of Bryan. Such a happy ending for him, doesn't it? Why Grey Worm doesn't kill Tyrion and Jon Snow? 2DB is so ridiculous. Why Sansa and Jon Snow are still alive? Dany fights for the north, she sacrificed one of her dragons - her child, she sacrificed most of her army, she lost her Jorah, and she gave up the Iron Throne for a while - the goal she fights for all her life. And what Sansa do to repay? Forgive, Distrust, Delay and Stab in the back. Do 2DB are mad? Stupid is not enough to explain why Episode 6 is so foolish, so silly, so ridiculous and so illogical.

Khaleesi delivers one of her more memorable and impassioned speeches and we think we're in for a real banger but with a sweet embrace the culmination of a decade of time invested ends not with a scream but with a whimper.At some point during the episode I thought they were trying to do comedic spin offs. It seemed there were a number of Seinfeld plot lines being spun up. I was thinking a Jon Snow night of the watch version of the office would be pretty funny considering there's nothing to watch over anymore. Glad to see him and ghost got their goodbye however but sort of awkward for the two of them because that didn't need to happenAll and all a pretty shabby and to an amazing show. There were some very bright and shiny moments to this season but this episode worked all but a few of them.

Tyrion finding his siblings curled together highlighted the poetry behind their deaths ( same as their births) and was very emotional to watch. Danys speech was terrifying and evoked the language used by tyrants of modern history ( the shot with the dragon wings behind her is wow).
The story was always going to end with the destruction of the iron thrones and the monarchy and I have to say the cgi of drogon was stunning. My favorite part of the episode is the epilogue; which I imagine is a grrm influence on the end; to show what comes after all the wars and the betrayals; how can a realm reconcile after years of violence and how to 'break the wheel'. The show runners had to grapple with the question of who ended up on the iron throne-to see that at the end, as long as there's a consensus it doesn't matter-and that the consensus is not to be inherited. The montage of Arya Jon and Sansa was particularly emotionally arresting, and provided the bittersweet ending this show deserves. It ended on a hopeful note",10,20 May 2019,158,434

I will admit things were a bit rushed through series 8, but I accepted that. These people giving this episode a 1 are probably the same people who complain about Star Trek timelines being wrong. Spare me. This finale tied up loose ends and left us believing that maybe, just maybe, Westeros and The North have happy futures ahead. I can't wait for the books to come out and then all these morons blaming D&D for a final series that they didn't like will see it was GRRM who put Bran on the throne, killed off Dany, sent Jon away, etc. It's always been known that he explained to D&D in detail what he wanted for the characters. So you don't like this ending? Go complain to GRRM. No, it's just easier to complain at D&D, right? Because you'd never complain to the man who created these characters and can do whatever he damn well pleases with them whether you like it or not. What I can't understand is if you all have hated Series 8 so much, WHY DO YOU KEEP WATCHING? No one is forcing you. Simply don't watch. But no, you gotta trash every single episode because it's not what you wanted. Aw, you poor widdle things. And the people that whine about the wasted years...are you serious? Really? So you don't like the ending, it's not what you wanted or expected, so all that came before was wasted time? You know what that's like? It's like saying ""Oh, I married and loved this person for 10 years and now they've died. I wasted 10 years of my life just for this?"" That's what you sound like. It's a TV show, people. It's there to entertain. It's not a political statement or a lifestyle choice. It's a TV show. If you're not entertained, DON'T WATCH.

Where to begin? The night king becomes a clown, is killed off like a common soldier , where was the long night? Where was the danger? Why didn't they simply send arya to kill him in the first place ? Jon's parentage is glossed over somehow everyone forgets that he just saved them and banish him ? Really? Why . It's a shame shame shame",1,21 May 2019,7,12

Episode 3 was really good, the battle against the whitewalkers actually delivered. Then the battle against cersei was a non-event. All through the series Cersei was one step ahead of her enemies, had tricks up her sleeve, made power plays and did the unexpected. So what happened here? Her whole plan relied on those elephants she never received? Pathetic. Slightly ruins the whole program. So many questions left unanswered. What was the whole point of jon snow being a targaryean?

Jon leaves the wall with the free folk, which seems like a nod to Bilbo and Frodo leaving for the Undying Lands.We get to see Sansa's arc come to completion where she begins as a naive little girl and become a strong independent leader of the North.Arya's arc while strange, will suffice.I feel as if the first half of the episode was predictable while the second half of the episode they just threw darts at ideas on the wall to see how to wrap up what was once, one of the best series on television.",2,20 May 2019,7,12

Great TV show, btw it was great, before of course, but every great show needs to go down in a hurry,
Game of Thrones did this in so many bad ways, plot holes, rushing it just to end the show,

Where do we start? the fact that they butchered the prophecy of jon snow? Lets say it ended as it is in GRRM story? why is it so rushed? almost everyone noticed that! and all of the sudden now no one calls him by his true name ''Ageon Targaryen'' the true heir! naaaah lets just use him and after that we toss him back to the night watch, YEET!

2233,"Before I start the actual review, it's needed to say that freedom of speech, though being one of most fundamental and necessary backbones of western civilization aka free world, has one major drawback: everyone can express their public opinions, even the most unwise, unqualified and inadequate ones, literally firing a lot of nonsense out of their mouths without thinking twice about what they are going to say.Sadly, this board, with all the 1/10 reviews, all the hateful comments and even threats, directed to the producers of this show, is a perfect example of what I'm saying.Was the entire 8th season very good? It's been decent, that's for sure, if felt a bit rushed, with what I can agree, and had some inconsistencies and logical drawbacks (speaking mainly about some battle tactics, which was already said by many viewers, so I don't want to go into details). Surely, it would have been better, if D & D could stretch the last season into ten or even twelve episodes, which would allow ending all the important story arcs at a slower pacing, thus explaining many things in detail.However, who are we to judge them? I am sure they had their reasons. The actors are surely tired after almost a decade of filming; the costs might be overwhelming; there can be other issues the crowd isn't aware of. So, in the end, they did what they had to do, with little harm. And, despite some inconsistencies, they did it well, ending with a finale which is perfectly logical and satisfying from a philosophical and educational points of view.I love how the producers of the show used the finale's series to send some very important underlying messages. The tragic story of Dany is a perfect parallel to some of XX century regimes, which promised liberation, but ended in tyrannies much worse than ones they dethroned; Brann being elected King by his personal qualities and not by birthright; finally, the idea that only those who are qualified enough (not the illiterate mob as Sam tried to propose!) should actually hold the privilege of electing the King and deciding the fate of the state. Finally, the smartest lord, one of the best diplomats still alive, appointed King's Hand despite all the past mistakes, cause there is no one who can do it better. Satisfying, to say the least.Of course, there is a small part of me that feels sad about the fate of Dany. But it was long expected (I actually predicted it's going to happen after she burned the Tullys) so we have to live with it.10/10 for the finale, and big thanks to D & D, the actors and all the stuff which kept this show alive for so many years - perhaps the greatest TV show since television has been created.",10,20 May 2019,206,577
2234,"Well, I have found myself here again. After watching the show since it began, and all the way through... I thought I would re-watch the whole thing again. I kept telling myself that I must have missed something. I had too high of expectations. There were some characters that did develop and I didn't pay attention. I truly wanted to believe it was my fault. That somehow...the world that I had come to love didn't let me down. That somehow, it was me. But that is what we tell ourselves in every bad relationship.Words truly cannot express the greatness that this show had in seasons 1-7. You hated people, you loved people, it was a mess...but it was the best kind of mess. The politics, war, strategy, character development, action, love and everything else was flawless. I could not stop watching, and I hated waiting so long for more seasons. I now wish they would have made us wait longer for season 8. I'm not going to pretend like I know exactly who caused season 8 to be what it was, but I know I am not alone in how much it crushed me to watch it.I agree with many people about the fact that some of what happened was true to the show. It just wasn't the GOT way of getting there. How many seasons did we spend on Bran and the 3 Eyed Raven? Only to get to a point where 1/2 of Brans lines were telling everyone that he wasn't Bran anymore. I also noticed in season 8 that Bran literally says something about not being able to be ""lord of anything"". Well, I guess the 3 Eyed Raven was wrong. I am not entirely sure how he was so important and also so boring and useless at the same time.I think having Dany become mad was always how this was supposed to end. Her behavior leading up to finally getting to Westeros proved that, even if we didn't want to believe it. Crucifixion, burning people, and locking a few in a vault are definitely acts that lead to being a tyrant. Killing one of her best friends in front of her was a good way to show her madness come to fruition. I just wish they would have spent another 3-4 episodes on the transition. The Great War was won, and then suddenly they were at the gates of kings landing. Murdering everyone, not even a whole episode later it seemed. We didn't sit through all of the character development and plot development to get to the action for 7 seasons...we sat through it because we loved it!!! You skipped the best part of the show to get to the final battle which left nothing to uncertainty. All of the sudden Drogon and Dany can burn Euron's fleet? Didn't a dragon just die from that fleet? And didn't Dany just try to dive bomb them before? I guess being in front of the sun was all she needed to do to defeat the best naval force in the world.Arya...i'm not even sure what to say. We spent a very long time watching her train to become something amazing. No one. And when she came back and killed the Freys, I was speechless. And then she used no more faces, killed the Night King by switching to her non-dominant hand, ran around kings landing for a whole episode, and then left Westeros. I think she was definitely the person to kill the Night King...it was just strange that he had a huge army in the Godswood and she flew out of no-where, and landed on him. And she didn't try to find Cersei. I know she must have changed and she cared for the innocent...but Cersei had been on her list for like the whole show. She wouldn't even have tried? Why didn't she go into the red keep with the Hound? Even if she didn't kill Cersei, what was the point of having her run all across Kings Landing? We knew Dany was bad at that point, we didn't need more proof.I all of the sudden didn't like Sansa anymore either. That may just be a person thing though, and not because of the last season.I'm sure there is more to say. Like something about the number of unsullied that I thought died, even though their whole army looked okay in Kings Landing. Maybe how the chicks from Dorne in the cell were never shown again. I know one of them died, but Cersei promised to keep the other alive as torture. Maybe how Yara was a big character for awhile and then suddenly non existent.Say what you will about Jon Snow...but the sight of him leading the Wildlings beyond the wall at the end, was one of the only redeeming qualities. He didn't want the throne. He was a good guy, and he belonged in the North. The show may have made him have a lesser role in the last season, but He was with his true family. The North. I fear the sadness and hurt I felt wasn't for Jon at the end though...but my own dissatisfaction with 95% of season 8. I'm just rambling at this point.TLDR: Season 8 hurt my heart. I miss the good writing and patient development.",3,1 March 2020,10,19

Last episode gets as follows:
2* for decent music
1* for visuals
1* for decent acting
0* for writing, closure.
So many mistakes made. Could have been somethig remarcable. Now its just mediocre.",4,23 May 2019,6,10
2287,"Truth is, the whole season sucked. It was so rushed, it left so many answers, even about the main villain, the Night King. The battle shouldn't have been just one episode, this should have been an epic battle, with secondary subplots, and even some of the heroes should have died there. Bran should have a role to play, not just sit there and warg, he did nothing heroic to get the throne in the end. Sansa was also hiding in the crypts, so again nothing heroic for her to make us like her, when in the ending she demanded her own throne in Winterfell and leaving her brother King of the six kingdoms!
Jaime and Brienne lovestory was useless to the plot. Jaime and Cersei killed by bricks in the arms of one another, as if we're watching a cheesy soap opera.
Daenerys killing and burning all people when she could have just gone straight to the castle and kill Cersei? Yep. Pure genius writing. Perhaps they could persuade us about the change that happened in Daenerys mind, but when everything is so rushed, there is no time for it!
Jon the most loyal of all, betrays the love of his life, when all his lines this season was constantly repeating that she's his queen! So he stabs Daenerys and she dies. Cheesy. Dragon didn't hurt Jon, but he melts the throne instead? Then he disappears.
Next, Jon is a prisoner and he is exiled to Night watch again. But wait, Bran is the King and he could have pardoned him for killing the mad queen? But no, Jon has to go there, and there is no reason the wall still exists when there is no threat now that the Night king is defeated.
Oh, and the prisoner Tyrion talks everyone into voting for Bran as King with no obvious reason? And Jon's heritage is forgotten by everyone?
Anyway, this season has completely ruined the show that was one of the best ever written. The ending was completely ridiculous.
Dear writers, DO NOT RUIN STAR WARS. Please hand in your resignations...",5,21 May 2019,6,10
2288,"This episode represents pretty much this whole series: totally underwhelming.
After so many years of an absolutely great show, with great characters and story lines, after taking so long to make this season and promising it would be epic, it should have left viewers amazed and excited and reeling and more. It didn't.
Yes they sort of tied up some lose ends but not in a way that was satisfying. Maybe the writers thought they were plot twists but it came across more as ""have the characters all lost their minds?!"". Very little made sense in terms of how you'd expect characters to react and how they dealt with the things that happened.
Most people were expecting this season to be a big show down with major characters meeting a special death and finish with a great finale that either would leave you happy and hopeful or shocked and worried (depending on the arc) for the future of Westeros, but we got a rushed half-hearted job and an anticlimax.
Even the visuals and music couldn't make up for the suddenly bland characters and plot.",2,21 May 2019,6,10

Similar to Daenerys, Jamie and Varys...Jon Snow told everyone about the Night King and united everyone to defend the people of Westeros against the common enemy. He united the Wildlings for the first time. He killed Daenerys to save thousands of innocent people... Yet he ends up in Nights Watch (and wtf? do you need a nights watch still). Yes, he maybe truly belongs to north and bla bla bla. But he deserves to be free and live with his honour. No one cared about this during the last meeting. He kind of is the Azor Ahai. But we needed to see one glorious moment with him before the show ended and it didn't happen...I have no words about Daenerys's ending. It was too rushed, didn't make sense at all. She saved all north last week and then she burned everyone in the next... I could see her becoming a tyrant but not this soon, not this rushed. This could happen slowly, in at least 2 more season!Bran as the king, I am fine with that. But I am not fine with Bran was planning this all the way storyline either. They could give him more things to do. They left with so many unanswered questions.Costumes, visual effects, dragons, CGI work, all the cool shots were great as usual. I loved Emilia Clarke's performance this season. Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner were very good as well.Thanks to everyone who made the GoT possible. Worked hard to do the best show on the planet.

The final episode gleefully continues the defilement of the show's characters, side plots and even the main story, concluding in a bizarre non-sequitur that seems to betray everything that came before.The first half of the episode was OK (well, given the ridiculousness of the Dany twist last week), but the second half descends into complete farce.Literally every plot of interest in the show is resolved in either haphazard unsatisfactory fashion or is just flat out ignored.Varys sending letters out to nobles with Jon's true parentage? Totally ignored.Jon's status as a Targaryen *and the rightful king*? Ignored like it doesn't exist, despite literally being the most notable and supposedly ""important"" build up of the show.Jon's status as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch? Ignored, because he is somehow banished *a second time*. Honestly, Jon's entire arc makes no sense whatsoever.Why does the Night's Watch even exist when the White Walkers are dead?Why does Bran have any claim to the throne whatsoever? He is just some randomer in a wheelchair, he's not even vaguely related to the claimants to the throne.Why does everyone think putting an omniscient man who can see the future into absolute power is a good idea, when it means he would be the ultimate tyrant? Bran is literally impossible to kill if he turns evil, because he can predict your every move. Nice job guys.Why is Bronn, one of the most immoral and dishonest characters in the show, charged with being Master of Coin and why is it treated as a joke? They've literally replaced Lord Baelish with another possibly even worse Lord Baelish.Why did Drogon randomly carry Dany away? Why do the Dothraki and Unsullied not just form a military junta and just conquer everything considering they still have the most massive army and have already taken the capital city?Why did Cersei do nothing all season? Why did Jaime have a complete personality breakdown? Why did Dany go nuts in 5 seconds? Why did Tyrion sell out Varys when it goes completely against his character and one episode later he totally agrees with him?Why? I think that's the message of the whole show. What was the point of anything? Why were all these plots set up and then completely freaking abandoned?Absolute cringe writing, backed with sublime visuals and acting. Very sad ending to a good show.",3,20 May 2019,6,10

I just want to forget this episode and the bad feeling it has left me. I still can't understand why they didn't make 10 episodes long. Sorry to say, but this season is just... oh wow, oh dear.

Boy was I wrong! Everything after that season was so bad and nonsensical and poorly executed.Season 8 was a disappointment after another, especially after episode 3. Now I won't lie, even though episode 5 made no sense from a narrative point of view, at least it was well shot and directed. The season finale on the other hand had zero redeeming qualities. Not a single thing was done well or made any sense save for maybe one scene involving Drogon and the iron throne (No spoilers).

Bran the broken? Really? Also, I was expecting some twist with Bran being connected to some magical sh** and him being on the throne would make sense. I really thought he had done something to prevent the night king from killing Arya or something when he warged into Crows? I guess.
But no, It was as simple as that. The only thing I liked about this episode was the scene with dead Dany and Drogon. That scene was brilliantly done IMO. But the things that followed up to that point made no sense. Jon used to be such a stubborn guy who always put innocent lives before him. Why would he need Tyrion's pep talk to understand Dany's intentions. After seeing that She killed all those innocent people, That should have been all the reason he needed to become the queen slayer. They totally ruined what Jon stood for. I hope David and Dan accept their mistakes and improve instead of defending it over and over again.",2,20 May 2019,6,10

I don't believe it ruined the previous seasons or how great the show really was as a whole. The fans deserved way better!! It does seem that everything they built up was destroyed, but it's just not true. I would just like to forget that is how they ended it and go with the ending for episode 5 as the ending of the show. I honestly think that would have been better. It's a shame they just didn't give us 1 more season so that they could have drawn out a better situation as to end the show on. It's very unfortunate that this was what we got after all that went into every character and every plot through the shows life. It's always a huge black eye to a show when your finale stinks, and it ruins its place all time as best show ever. It loses a few notches in my book just based on the boring uninteresting finale that the writers and HBO decided to throw together and give us loyal fans. What a shame.!!",5,20 May 2019,6,10

The beginning of season 8 was suck exalterating but once after the Winterfell war against the king of the dead I feel like everything was rushed up. I believed this ending could have end better much better. Yes it may not change anything but when you have such a high level of viewers and fans to the shows don't make an end that no one want to see or else if you do make it actually good. Many time during the finally I felt like some of the passage could have better in terms on discussion between characters like it felt like it was rushed up. Furthermore, after Jon stab you know who he gets taken in custody by the unsoleed, like where and how could they have know he did it when Cleary the dragon flew off with dannerys body and the dagger like where the logic in that????",1,20 May 2019,6,10

When Jon kills Dany, I really felt for him, because he had to what he had to do, and I had to do what I had to do, which was watch a dumb season finale for the sake of waiting for so long.
What is great about GOT is the twists and turns, but twists and turns for the sake of twists and turns is just ......",1,20 May 2019,6,10
2390,Season 8 had some great moments but it was clear that D.B weiss and david benioff were clearly just over it. This episode is the penultimate F U to the viewers. They clearly stopped caring about the series so they could start working on star wars. I think that shows a lot of what will happen to star wars when the next thing comes along for them. Will they ruin the star wars saga too? Terrible ending to one of the best shows i have ever seen. D.B Weiss and David Benioff should be blacklisted from making anything again.,1,20 May 2019,6,10
2392,It just didn't feel like Game of Thrones. Breaking Bad is an example on how to write a good ending. Dexter was a bad ending. This is somewhere inbetween. Daenerys death is treated like an afterthought. One of GoT's most divisive and interesting characters killed off and gone so soon. Where did the dragon even go? This wasn't bittersweet. It was light and airy like a generic fantasy ending. Okay. So what about the three eyed raven? Nightt king???? What about the targaryens!? The last one is banished to the wall. Grey worm was barely angered about her death. And the dothraki forgot about her,1,20 May 2019,6,10

No reasoning, no character development, a big insult to the fans is how I can describe this season.

Why did the creators show Jon as the true heir.. what was the point?
I have no idea how HBO allowed this at all. Some people might call it poetic ending or something, but it's not. It's dumb, it's boring and it did not make any sense.

2405,"I am very disappointed that all the leaks were 100% precise. I understand that dany's fate was always going to take a similar direction. They rushed it, that's why it feels out of character. And I agree that Jon should head back to the north, besides he never wanted to rule. But, why dany had to die? Why title her as 'mad queen '? Her actions are not because of madness, they are because of sadness, emptiness, fear and disappointment. Jon shouldnt kill her. Tyrion has become a very unlikable character this season. He acts only based on emotion. He betrayed his friend for his 'queen' and now betrayes her. Dany was a strong, fierce leader who was always ready to do what the others wouldnt, because of their weakness. You could say that she slaughter thousands of people for the sake of the future generations. They would have never accepted her. These were the people that were celebrating a noble man's execution (ned) . The people that never stood against their selfish and corrupted ruler. A person doesnt get mad from one day to another. Painful things happen in life that may lead to atrocious decisions, but with time she would have become herself again. It is truly heartbreaking for jon to take so much crap all of his life. Such a devastating ending, for a story that had such potential.",2,20 May 2019,36,88

2408,"It does not really matter here whether the fans got what they expected or they did not. It is impossible to satisfy all. It is quite understandable that Jon Snow, due to his rigidity, honor and honesty, ended up like he does in the world of questionable moral qualities and cunning politics. Daenerys went bloodthirsty mad? Nothing new, even Hitler was motivated by noble goals in early days, at least for his people and country, epilogue was biggest disaster of 20th century. It is not strenge that Ayra decided to investigate the world. After all, she is still teenager. New Coin Minister? Threats have already earned him enough, why not this? Bran becomes a king? If Donald Trump can, anyone can. All this is just a writer's freedom, and only fools would complain about such things. However, the amount of superficiality, stupidity and illogicality at the logical and narrative level is just staggering and can not be justified in any imaginative way.
Three Starks are present at the key meeting of all houses representatives? Why? Who is Ayra representing? Brienne? Sir Davos? After a brief talk of a man actually not allowed to speak at all, everyone present absent minedidly accepts a new king? The man they saw for the first time in their life? Sansa takes the whole North as a separate kingdom with one sentence? If she is so powerful, why should she compromise on the destiny of her brother Jon Snow?
Gray Warm and unsullieds? Are they the victorious conquerors in charge of the city, and, consequently, rest of the realm, or the remnants of the finished and broken narrative, depleated army without leader and cause? If the former, why Tyrion and Snow are even alive? Why the Council of Representatives? If later, who gives them right to judge anyone, let alone Jon Snow, behind whom is the whole north?

It would have been better if the show has been cancelled, because although the earlier seasons are some of the best narrative I've ever seen on TV, the whole show is now marred by this half assed trainwreck of an ending.

Foreshadowing was not built up to mark. All prophecies were like they never existed. It felt like This season had no connection to previous seasons. Changing a heroine to a villain just for the hero boyfriend to kill her and become even more ideal than he already is. - Is Cliche .
People defending this horrible writing haven't been watching the show properly I would say. Too many unconnected dots, too many places where logic dies, too many things done wrongly for the shock value. Speech in the end- Indirectly Describing how killing ""evil men"" was madness, is A VERY WRONG MESSAGE. Don't justify your writing by saying "" she was mad all along"" because she killed those who deserved to die! Daenerys truly deserved a better ending.

Weiss and David Benioff; thank you for teaching us this lesson:Cersei had it wrong from the beginning.

Have every person with ambitions to power been killed? Everyone suddenly listens to calm compromises. It seems very unrealistic in light of the last 72 (!) episodes.Since the Unsullied were the only ones with actual land armies who wanted Jon punished, and they left - why didn't just Jon walk away? Sansa would never have stopped with ""Oh, but those Unsullied on the other side of the ocean will come back and beat us up if I don't abide by what they told us before. Sorry Jon!"".Also, Greyworm would absolutely have killed Jon on the spot if he realized he had killed Daenerys. It is INSANE to think he would have reacted with: ""What's that, he killed my queen? Well of course he needs a fair trial! Because that's what we are all about! Fair trials and correct jurisdiction. We don't just kill people on the spot! Also, it's not like I had some deep emotional bond with my now murdered queen. At least nothing that trumps my deep love and respect for proper judicial conduct.""Also, a small detail, but still: A good king wouldn't let Bron get EVERYTHING he threatened with murder to get. That's not a good start of a new reign.Though: Brienne's scene with her saying Goodbye to Jamie by writing about him. was beautiful.Still.

Just stopping on his way for a quick confrontation with muppet Greyjoy - checkTwo of the most clever and cunning men in Westeros behaving like idiots - checkA girl with no name (again) dropping the most important name on her list because uncle Hound says so, that way she can be the point of view in the destruction of King's Landing. Yes Benioff and Weiss, of course, this way we care so much more about those poor people.A Breaker of Chains, Stormborn etc etc going full-on mad queen in a heartbeat, roasting everyone in King's Landing without any proper story build-up, and then ending dressed Darth-Vader style (imperial march plays). Evidently a few foreshadowing nuggets here and there have replaced character development in Benioff and Weiss's ""storytelling one-on-one"".A King in the North, true heir to the Iron Throne, who, after prevailing against unsurmountable odds and uniting people of different lands and banners does not get the satisfaction of facing off his nemesis (see above) and is demoted to ""talking extra"" mumbling the lines ""I won't do it"" and ""she's my queen"" over and over again. That's until he is sent back north for killing Darth Vader. What the hell Jaime Lannister was pardoned 20 years earlier for killing the Mad King, no? And sent North to protect it from what???- checkA Three-eyed raven doing absolutely nothing until and after the climax. We might as well had him wheeled off the wall a couple of seasons ago. The ending for his character made no sense. Bran ""the broken effing bicycle, first of his name""- checkA fan service ending where everyone gets a piece of the cake. Some people have an option to become an independent kingdom, others don't. Some sellsword gets High Garden and becomes Master of Coin (good luck with that), some fatso becomes Grand Maester even if he dropped out of school, some smuggler becomes Master of Ships. It's like starting a story like The Godfather and ending it like My Little Pony.They could have planned an 8x episodes season in order to have time to complete the story in a more logical way, rather than frantically rushing through the checkboxes like a college student who realizes there are only 10 mins left to complete the test.

Yes, the ending contains several elements that make no sense BUT, you can't discount the production value and acting even if the story doesn't add up. My 5 rating is to split the 0 for writing and 10 for cast and crew.A few things. How do you exile Jon to Castle Black? It serves no purpose anymore. Wildlings made peace and the white walkers are dead, right? Then he just walks beyond the wall to live out the rest of his life? Really? How are the unsullied going to check him if they have all sailed to Naath, or wherever their going. Jon should have said "" aw seven hell's, I'm going back to Winterfell. Later losers""Bran "" the broken"" is king??? Nothing more needs to be said here. I'll just get stupider thinking about it.Bronn appears out of no where at the new small council meeting and all is well between him and Tyrion after their last meeting??

Danaerys' death through Jon was predictable though I'm glad Arya didn't get the kill this time but I couldn't buy Dany turning delusional with what she tells Jon before her death, I guess you could also find her character arc dead under the rubble of red keep. Also realised lords of Westeros are absolute cucks, so Sansa infront of them has her independence wish granted and Iron islands that have fought for autonomy for decades are absolutely fine with being ruled by a person they didn't even vouch for lmao. The whole scene plus the time gap between Dany's death and Tyrion's trial felt Ill -paced, rushed and left a bland after taste. I didn't mind how most characters ended up but the ambiguity left behind of Brian's true intentions left me unsatisfied. At least this episode didn't contain any major subversion of expectations, because I fully believed Dave and Dan to pull out something worse than they did.

..But also because it's the laziest ending I've ever seen. It felt like characters who had clear purpose and development were overturned because D&D had no idea what to do with them after daddy warbucks stop feeding them ideas.
So they halted everyone's ark and just stuck them at different corners of the world and the killed the checklist 'had to go' characters.But the worst part was, by the time Daenarys was wrapped up and they were all squabbling over who's now ruler, I just wanted it to end. I honestly couldn't care less who did what or how it was going to finish. It was so underwhelming that it can't even be called bad. It wasn't. It was just so...very...bland.

Later, the scene with bran and his small council was just more useless filler. Jon ended up back where he started, at the wall and beyond, making his parentage and whole journey actually quite pointless. The only part I was happy with was Sansa as Queen in the North. An underwhelming end to an epic series. The writers had absolutely no tricks up their sleeves.",2,20 May 2019,5,8
2501,"So, after watching this episode I was just disappointed.For me there were 4 main characters : Jon, Dany, NK and Cersei.
The NK died in a big battle,it wasn't perfect, but it was at least Arya(a person) who killed him. Then Cersei who was hated by a lot of people got crushed by rocks.
Dany who was there from the beginning was killed in about 2 seconds and Jon who came back to life for something was forgotten this whole season.My version(I'm no expert/writer):First 2 episodes were fine, nothing magnificent, but alright.
After those they should've switched the 2 battles, first deal with Cersei, win and then decide what to do(they could even escape with Jamie, i don't care)
Even Dany could turn insane, but Bran(warg Drogon) could stop him and they could save the city and Dany as well. Bran then could actually do something useful in both battles.
They wouldn't abandon Winterfell, a small army would stay there with a few important characters, like Sansa, Brienne who protects Sansa and few more. Obviously they loose, some of them escape like Sansa, but Brienne dies protecting her. Every important character who dies will be resurrected by NK and in the battle the living people would have to face their friend in zombie form which would've looked awesome.
Then many people die, in the end Jon and Dany rule together in every kingdom(even in the North, because of Jon) Dany cannot have children so the whole born into ruling would be solved. Sansa would be Wardeness of the North and Arya would sail west.Okay it doesn't have to be a happy ending, but then don't try to be one, today's episode tried to end happily, but it did not.",3,20 May 2019,5,8

The feeling that I have is that producers sat at the meeting table and said ""look, let's finish this in 6 episodes, I don't care how you will do this, just end it"", because so many story arcs and possibilities just ended abruptly, it seems that no one really cared if it was going to be too obvious, they just did it.

The story, in its entirety, has gone to garbage. It's comprehensible that this show must conclude by tying up its loose ends, but the writers obviously fail to effectuate this; how poorly orchestrated the eighth season is, is a testament.

Jon reduced to a servant who kills her queen. Danny's death scene had as much dramatic climax as a death in Celebrity Deathmatch. Tyrion is the first and only prisoner who propose a new king... And became hand of the king! That's having a lot of luck. A Dragon that burns a throne because he understands more than anybody that it's the symbol of greed...

I was like WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING PLEASE JUST MAKE IT END. Bran becoming king was fine, but it just made no sense as far as all the years of build up surrounding Dany and Jon. The last two episodes just felt like the writers were making every choice just to do something crazy that nobody would expect, like they took every speculation they'd heard from the internet and said we'll do this one thing nobody thought of just so they'll be surprised and in doing that they erased years of character development and plot-building.So my only solace is that it all felt very television, and I hope that means the book will effing do it right.

And why was Jon resurrected by the lord of light? He did almost nothing against the dead (Arya could've prolly killed nk anyway) and I can't imagine a god caring much about human politics.
I don't really get why they went for the whole bran-the-broken and his clumsy council jokey tone. It is the finale after all, and it follows a heartbreaking scene, so I don't see the need for humor.
Also the part where Tyrion justifies to Jon the twist of Dany turning mad is awful. If you wrote a good story you wouldn't have to justify it to the audience. It's almost like trying to make yourself believe it was a good choice.",1,20 May 2019,5,8

2622,"Multiple scenes from this episode didn't make any sense, at all. First of all, Why did Drogon carry Daenerys away? we already know that once a dragons rider dies, the dragons finds another dragonrider to bond with, this happened multiple times with the biggest known dragon, Balerion, which is mentioned (and shown; the skull at least) in the show, why wouldn't he bond with Jon, it wasn't because he killed Daenerys, we know that Maegor the first killed other Targaryens, that didn't stop Baelerion from bonding with him.Secondly, i have never in my live, laughed harder than when Bran answered Tyrion ""why do you think i've come so far?"" or something close to that, i don't remember word for word, can't be bothered rewatching to find out, it is THAT bad.
So his focus has to be on learning the history, which is also why he refuses to be lord, or anything, yet he accepts the crown, with a witty comment?????? The writers have shown that they cannot write a good show if there lives depended on it, ever since the show couldn't rely on the rich, beautiful, amazingly well-written story from GRRM, it has gone downhill, and this season, especially this last episode, even with it's massive budget, almost made me fall asleep.The third thing is, why would Sansa ever accept Jons sentence, she literally just said that she, and the north will never bow again, and that she wanted him freed, she even threatened with the northern army 2 minutes before?? but then.... she... changed her mind i guess? for some reason?I hope to forget season 7 and 8.

Too obvious.The problem lies in the fact that this episode is boring and slow, and there are so many scenes where you, as an spectator, feel like the writers are making fun of you.
The scene in which they decide who should rule? What is that attempt of being funny as if this show was a sit-com? And when Tyrion and the others are gathered at the table...The whole dialogue was pointless. We all know Bran knows it all. We all know Bronn wants some brothels.Again.

I still love Jon Snow. the ultimate shield of the realm. He once made a choice to protect the realm and he keeps with that promise.
Ofcourse the writing in the last episodes was sometimes a bit bluntly with some unrealistic moves by some characters, but if you want to see characters grow and lots of side information and growing of plots you should read a book. Because in a book you have time for these things. In a televisionshow you have spectacle/ special effect and less time.

The great thing about GOT was always the unexpected, the twists & turns in the story and of course all the smaller & bigger details that forshadowed coming events. This was never a show about happy endings or neat & clean heroes, it was like real life, it showed real people that were hurt, or damaged, cruel, or manic, broken or weak or drawn to the extreme. All in all a realistic prtrayal of life in a medieval setting. Could it have ended differently ? Sure !

From completely erasing seasons of character development with Jaime, to abruptly ending the whole ""winter is coming"" arc with a quick, anticlimactic death for the Night King, and then randomly giving Bran the crown for seemingly no reason at all, without anyone else really even trying to get it, the writers have delivered possibly the worst send off to this show that they possibly could have.They spent the first 7 seasons carefully building up to what should have been some truly amazing climaxes, only to abandon pretty much everything in the final season.

Game of Thrones has been like a really rough relationship. And I've never been more invested in a story or character development like I have in Game of Thrones.
So how do I feel when the characters lost the identity of themselves and are just somewhat rushed to a very odd conclusion? I feel robbed of 2 years waiting. I feel robbed of eight or nine years, where it's been alot of heartbreaking moments - for it to end like this? I'm really sorry for David and Dan. Without any of the source material they have absoluty no talent. I cannot understand why we got cool & gorgeous scenes traded in for the writing who was so out of touch from what it just to be. With GRRM's vision and help of course.I sincerely wish and hope that D&D does well in Star Wars. But I'm going to be as far away that I possibly can be - because I don't trust them to actually pull it off.And I would like to thank everyone who made the show for what it was for so many years, I'm just so disappointed that it had to end in a rushed way.

The fact that Bran became king is infuriating at best. And how utterly insulting is it to send Jon Snow back to the Night's watch! The fact that he's actually the rightful heir has been rendered completely meaningless. Being sent off to an organisation which now only exists in name, which has no purpose anymore (the wildlings are at peace with the north and the white walkers are dead), seems like rubbing salt in the wound. The same can be said about that awful counsel scene, insulting us by naming the book: 'a Song of Ice and Fire' and not including Tyrion, which is, as expected, completely nonsensical seeing how he played an integral part in shaping the course of history. This pile of foul stenching waste can be blamed for actively undermining the previous 7 seasons, a sin which I can not even bestow upon the walking dead, which is a stumbling corpse in itself.

The more you disect the writing and plot of the current season the worse it becomes. I mean seriously?, what happened to Jon's arc? He LITERALLY ended up in the exact position he started in (the wall). What progression into true leadership did he make? What were all his sacrifices worth? (killing Danny). The answer is nothing and this is one problem out of many I have. All the characters ended with such unsatisfaction and it is a hell of a shame.To conclude my rant, the main problem is fans have invested over 8 years and hours into a beautiful fantasy tale that differed so much from the rest.

The acting, the score, the directing, the special effects, the editing, aka everything but the writing, was phemonemal. I'd rate the episode a 9 or 10 if I were judging on those components alone.

2692,"I think the best comparison of season 8 is with Lost. Where Lost was one of the first shows to suffer from internet fans predicting the plot/ending and seemed unsure how to see it through once this happened, GoT did the opposite; unfortunately the result is a mess, in which no character feels to have had the end of their arc developed competently in the final season.
I'm not condemning the final result, simply the way it got there. A mere 6 episodes forced everything to happen far too quickly; the Night King's demise seemed only to serve to make us need the spin-off series in order to tell his story properly; Danaerys going mad and being killed by Jon Snow was tragic, yet they could not devote more than a few minutes screen time to it etc.
Part of me is cynical enough to believe that, once they had overtaken the books, Martin stopped helping in the knowledge that many people would turn to the books (if they are ever finished) to obtain a satisfying resolution, once HBO screwed up what is arguably the best show in TV history.

It was like I was watching a parody - a joke. I don't know how anyone who worked on the show could have let this ending happen. So many endings ruined. Why did Arya learn her faceless skills? Since when did she want to explore west of Westeros? Why was there such big build ups about Jon being a Targareyan if nothing came from it? Why was the Night King evil? He would have to be the worst villain in history - zero motives to his actions.I could go on forever.I give one star to the music and acting. The other star is for Sansa's ending.

The main characters, Dany and Jon, were sidelined and murdered literally and figuratively for no goddamn reason making everyone ask why? WHY did anything occur in this show when none of the prophecies, foreshadowing, or character development mattered in the end.
They created a beautiful show that ended on the most lazy, cheap, illogical ending where the moral is: women and logic be crazy!!

Whoever paid for this production has to be asking D&D just where the heck did all the money go because they clearly cut corners on EVERYTHING.Fans hung in there watching this train wreck of a season for the joke it was, just to see how much worse it would get & episode 6 didn't disappoint.The train finally crashed & went up in flames. Now we can finally turn away.Let me just leave on this point to let it sink in how horrible this was. Are you ready? lol OK. So.. When Bran enter the meeting after being crowned king, who remembers him clearly asking Tyrion and the others where the other 2 people were?... Bran... you do understand that you are supposed to know EVERYTHING right? THAT'S HOW YOU GOT THE JOB!!! lol... YOU TELL US!!! smh.

The finale may actually be the worst finale in history when you consider the magnitude of how wonderful this show was and what it meant to millions around the world. This is worse than the LOST finale and that's saying something. The episode starts out pretty somber with some really terrible dialogue in several scenes. At times the characters seemed like robots because their lines were cringeworthy.....Everything felt so rushed. Even though I disagree with several people being upset with Daenerys turning bad, the way her death was rushed in the finale was poorly executed. It actually made me rethink whether D&D did indeed butcher her character in some ways...We clearly needed more episodes. I promise I'm not saying that as a fan, I'm saying that in a very reasonable and logical way. And no I don't mean that in a greedy god awful AMC type of way with Walking Dead. But damn it with such a complex world and dynamic characters, 6 episodes werent enough! HBO wanted more but D&D were ""burnt out"". What a joke. Well if you're reading this D&D, congrats. Was it worth it looking back now? One of the most tragic things that could ever happen to a long running show is NOT finishing on top....Because no matter how many good years you've had, the finish line is the most important aspect because it leaves a nasty stain on years and years of hard work if you can't finish. 20 years from now more people will be talking about how badly GOT ended as opposed to how good the show was. Because of your laziness and incompetence, this is all on your hands...We were shown for years and years that the Night King and white walkers were the most terrifying force imaginable. And it all ended so quickly. There's so much about the Night King we deserve to know. I thought maybe we would get some glimpses or answers in some way in the finale but nope! Once again these were signs of a rushed and lazy season. With no source material to fall back on(the books), D&D have shown they aren't that talented after all.What they did to Jon Snow was a disgrace...The Stark family is loaded with power now and after Jon Snow basically saves generations and generations of people, they were like ""yeah sorry you're banished it has to be this way better luck next time"".....You mean to tell me you couldn't start a campaign explaining to the masses Jon Snow was the rightful heir to begin with and he had to do this? What a joke....And then Arya is like ""Yeah I'm prob not going to visit you Bc I'm going to go off an be an explorer"" lmao...Yeah ok. I'm not going to lie my heart is broken over this.

King Elected, Brandon the Broken? What was that joke of a council for!? Also why Greyworm had to give a damn to their decisions? Why?
Tyrion actually gave Bronn High Garden, and a seat in the small council? What a joke! D&D managed to make me hate every character they wrote, even Bronn.
Oh, the North wouldn't kneel to Brandon Stark, but to Sansa Stark - no problem.
Or was it Sansa who wouldn't kneel to her little brother? Who did she think the future king of Westeros should be, her or her brother's children? Just why? All so confusing!P.S.
While visiting Tyrion, Jon: ""I can't justify what happened"".
minutes later also Jon: ""Cercei left her no choice ... She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.""What? How? I though I knew how dumb D&D could be.",2,20 May 2019,3,4

Bran was not even in the last sequences when the Stark children were shown for the final moments. It was beyond disappointing.

2741,"Game of Thrones was a show that many of us are emotionally invested in, many of us identify with the characters and are very interested in their fates. In my opinion, many fans had an idea of how they wanted the show to end, and unless that ending happened, they were going to be upset. The current IMDB rating reflects that sentiment, it's almost fully split down the middle. For me, the decision to make Bran king was as good a choice as any. He is the Three-Eyed Raven, making him the wisest man alive. Many complaints have been levied, accusing Bran of doing nothing and not developing. But Bran is the Three-Eyed Raven, not a regular man, so he just kind of hangs out, knowing more than any human alive in Westeros. Who better to be king? Why does he have to fight in a war or sire children to be a good king? Wisdom is the best attribute a ruler can have, and Bran has the most of any candidate. So, please stop hating and accept that things turned out the way they did. No, Jon and Dany didn't get married and have kids while ruling fairly and justly, instead, the six kingdoms got a ruler infinitely more wise.",7,20 May 2019,3,4
2743,"While it's certainly a let down it doesn't deserve the 1* ratings.
I think the show became a victim of its own success and was never going to live up to the hype, especially after the source material ran out.A lot of this season has been 'ok', some of it even very good but by its own standards it has just been a bit average.You could pick holes in a lot of the writing this season but for me the biggest problem has been their ability to write the deaths of important characters, the Knight Kings was meh, Jamie and Cerci's was meh and now Dany's, it was like a bad B movie. I will forever love this T.V show and do feel like some of the hate was unjustified, but it has certainly been a huge let down of a final series and finale for me!

2758,"About Dany's death, I guess D&D tried to shock audiences like people were shocked but excited when Ned Stark and Robert Stark got killed in previous seasons( plots were followed by Martin's book). however, this time, the way that Dany died, has shocked people, yes, but is a sick way. One is a genius shock to audiences, and this one is Grosss...shock. The reason I watched GoTfinal is because I just want a period to close my 9 years watching, and see how worst it can be. Well, I was ""surprised""by D&D again. When Tyrion and Jon had this conversation in jail,I was so sick to watch, I almost vomit, I meant it. I never agree with Tyrion is the smartest character in this show, cuz I don't even remember what he exactly did and planed for smart moves, except his talking skill, and no one shut his up, never. I understand how he loves his brother, but I don't understand as the hand of queen, a grown man, the smarest person in seven kingdoms, can ignore the cruelness of a war, and forget why they have a war with his lovely sister right now...and he just let his brother go and get a reunion with the number enemy. Are you kidding me? you can blame Dany, but plz has a better reason. For Jon, depending on D&D's plots, the big tragedy and problem here is he really believed that other people(especially Sansa/Tyrion)believe that he is the true king and the rightful king...the results turn to so ironic . Tyrion just use him to kill Dany, Sansa already decided to claim the throne in North no matter who is gonna sit in the iron throne, and Bran's part is the most ""interesting "" to kick Jon's ""rightful king"" position. I love house of Stark once, and I agree that Sansa has ability to take the throne, especially better than Jon, BUT, not copy little finger and Cersei. Before final episode, I think Arya is doing okay, even she is the one suddenly killed the night king for whatever business between these two previously. however, I don't like the way she acted in final episode, tried to scare everyone who against Stark, no, not cool. In the end, I am so sorry to put 9 years loyalty in this show.",1,20 May 2019,3,4

What is this episode ?!The way to picture how democracy was formed?! John's destiny was to become the king, he is the heir!!! So he did what he did that's how kings usually take the throne and don't become prisoners!!!
This episode was an insult to our inteligence, our loyallty all those years and an terrible injustice to the wonderfull characters we all learned to love. But the number one victim is off course John Snow . . .

2764,"Starting from 8x04 (and tbh from 8x03 but I was still defending the show back then), all the storyline and characters established were thrown away like garbage. Not only the consistency between the seasons but also the consistency between episodes.
Like in 8x05 we saw Arya running around in KL and rode a horse coming from nowhere at the end. Why the horse suddenly disappear this episode, and what's the point of film here running around if she is not going to do ANYTHING at all this episode?
Also, if Bran always knew he is going to be king, then what's the point of Jon being a Targaryen and why did Bran bother to tell him that? Did Bran just tell him to lead to the consequences that Dany will burn down KL and millions of people die because of it? Then I guess Bran is not a really good king then. Not to mention the king election part is so stupid that it looks like a bunch of pre-school kids electing the class representative.
And Tyrion. Tyrion's IQ has dropped drastically since S5, but he was always loyal. But now he is such a jackass that he convinced Jon to kill Dany, her queen? Why would anyone still want him to be the hand? Like maybe someday Tyrion will just decide that this is not the king/queen he wants and then conspire with other people to kill the king/queen.
Not to mention the 180 degrees change of attitude of Grey Worm after Bran was elected to be king (like the whole Unsullied and Dothraki love Dany and I don't think they will let Jon get pass killing Dany that easily), and the spawning Unsullied and Dothraki (they were supposed to be so dead after 8x03, esp for the Dothraki lol) and many other things.
To be honest the biggest shock of S8 is how D&D manage to kill the show in just 4 episodes. Bravo I guess.

MUCH MORE!>> Grey worm takes the prisoner against other kings, so that the prisoner decides his and others future!? In a second, Grey Worm was so decided and imposing that he would severely punish John and Tyrion, in the second following: ""Go there Tyrion, and tell us who will be our new King"" .. LOL>> Sansa, ""the revolted one"", does not accept to be under the dominion of the younger brother, still sends John to the Wall for her to be the new Queen of the North.>> Dragon disappears.>> No more criticism because that's all that happened.I keep here imagining, what if the control of the script was still entirely in George R.R.

It feels like the writers want to do the unexpected and so ignored the character development of 7 seasons, ignored their adoring fans and gave us an ending that was so... Average, that we're left wondering why we spent nearly 10 years falling in love with these characters.
You have given us so many wonderful and shocking moments throughout 7 seasons, it was a shame to end it this way.

I don't know a single friend or acquaintance from the people around me that has watched the previous seasons and likes that season, all people are shocked by the entire lack of imagination, continuity and GoT realism in this season. A lot of questions needed answering in the show: who is the Lord of Light? Who is the Night King and he actually wanted? What Varys heard in the flames? Who are the faceless men really? And many more of those... I believe the great many people that watched this show until now deserve for the first time in history a remake of this season to be made.",1,20 May 2019,3,4

2807,This is my first review and it was earned. Absolutely loved this show for 7 seasons and 3 episodes. The Last 3 episodes were complete garbage and the finale took the cake. They just straight up didn't even try to finish strong and it is embarrassing to even think this season was made by the same directors.,1,20 May 2019,3,4
2808,"Terrible season, but this episode was pretty much just boring. Almost no dialogue, and the dialogue that is there is really stupid. Making Bran king is pretty silly. Sending Jon north is kinda hilarious. Dany's death was very, very funny. Probably one of the most poorly shot things in the series. It's funny how a city just got destroyed and several major characters are dead, as well as almost a million innocent citizens, yet the Red Wedding still had a lot more impact.This loses a lot of points honestly for just making me feel nothing. When I finished the books, I felt empty. I was upset. It took a few days for me to recover from it. And maybe that's because the books aren't finished. But this final episode literally made me feel nothing but bored. I kept checking how much was left.All in all, a really bland and dull episode. Not worth the watch, not worth the eight years. Although it was plain this was going to be the case, ever since the butchery of Tyrion in season 4, when they felt the need to remove anything interesting from Tyrion and Jaime's relationship. The writers just hate anything that might possibly be interesting.",3,20 May 2019,3,4

They must not have known how to end things and decided to make very unenthused, simplistic choices to get rid of the storylines and make a ""resolution"". Lamest deaths of the entire series in this season, despite it being the finale which should be powerful and unthinkable! This ep is and hour and 20 of talking with dialogue that feels like it's from a show in modern times. Jon defending dany because ""her friend and dragon got killed"". This isnt a show about feelings! War is supposed to be calculated and for the greater good. Not a hussy fit over TWO DEATHS. Cant believe dany is defeated in such an unnecessary way. No drama, no action. Shes just stabbed, despite not even really showing any aggression or need to be eliminated on the spot. I'm fairly certain this ending will go down in history as the biggest flop. So sad that it feels this is how all cinema and television has been lately. It starts out intense and enthusiastic and then becomes uninspired garbage to make money without any passion. Westworld, star wars, all the huge franchises following the same pattern. Makes me feel like the viewers mean nothing to these people!",1,20 May 2019,3,4

The Night King was such a major yet mysterious threat that terrified everyone, yet he is gone in one major battle?The finale was too predictable after episodes 4 and 5. Of course Jon had to kill Dany, he was the only one who could get close to her. But right at the beginning? Come on! Of course Tyrion had to stand before the remaining leaders, but the time jump was ridiculous, and the explanation why Jon wasn't there was flimsy and contrived. He should have been a witness to the discussion.The entire season appears to be the writers' exercise of discovering every fan theory, then throwing it out, and coming up with something so contrived because it was all that was left to choose from.So many great and interesting characters a

2833,"What happened? Why did they do this?! Why did they turn everything and twist everything this season? This is not the show we started watching 8 years ago. These are not the characters we fell in love with over 7 seasons. We went through so much with the characters over these years. Those we hated we grew to love. Those we liked we grew to adore. And some became the villains that we all loved to hate.
Our favorite characters died. And we cried. Some came back to life. And we screamed in joy. Some fell in love, some betrayed their love. And we were always there... watching and waiting.
When I think of Game of Thrones, there is one word that came to my mind over the seasons more than any other.... PAIN. This show was always filled with pain. But there was always light in that pain. There was always HOPE in that pain. Even at the red wedding we hoped... we hoped for justice... we hoped for love to win above all. Always we hoped. No matter how many we loved were gone, we always hoped that their sacrifice was for good in the end.
We continued to watch through all the pain because we hoped and we dreamed of the bliss - the light - at the end of the tunnel. We knew that one day our heroes would win. We knew that the sacrifice of our fallen would be avenged by our heroes. We knew that one day the ruler of the seven kingdoms would be our heroes and that Game of Thrones would be the utopia everyone dreamed of.
I fell in love. From the beginning of the show I fell in love. Over 7 seasons I fell in love with Daenerys... the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains. Over 7 seasons I fell in love with Jon Snow... the King of the North and the moral compass of the show. In season 7 I cheered when the two characters I loved the most finally met. I thought ""after all this pain, the two most perfect for eachother will finally unite!""
And from there a dangerous fantasy grew. A fantasy that was born from hope. A fantasy that Danny and Jon would fall in love and rule together. The two heroes would rule the Seven Kingdoms. All the pain and heartbreak of this show would be worth it in the end. Because all of their pain and heartbreak would lead to a blissful end.
But I was wrong. WE WERE BETRAYED. In the matter of 6 episodes one hero became a villain. Our other hero became a follower. Jon... who was once a follower that died because of his moral compass came back as a LEADER. In 6 episodes he became a follower with a broken compass. Danny who was once a Mother of freedom... became the Mother of pain. In the end... she died... and he was banished.
In the end the Starks would never meet again.
In the end the characters that became our family became strangers to not only eachother... but to US.
What happened to our heroes?
WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR SHOW?
WE STAYED THROUGH THE PAIN IN HOPE OF JUSTICE.

King Bran is off warging while his council of misfit lords is back to daily business as usual. . Sansa gets to be queen, Aryia an adventurer, Jon the king north of the wall, Sam gets his maestership, Braun king of coin, Davos master of ships, Jamie gets his story told and even Podric gets to be a knight.

They tied all their loose ends and ended it in a manner that I was not expecting, hence the two stars, but I can also strongly say that this season of Game of Thrones was incredibly hard to watch and this final episode was, by far, the hardest.
History will remember Game of Thrones dearly, for not many have started to splendidly, turned into a masterpiece and then finished as less than terrible.

Its realy not the worst show ever, not by far. But the way it ended is what made it hurt so much more than if it was just some CW show. This was GOT, the show known for its writing and deep lore and plot, not ""generic fantasy no. 365"" on History channel.",3,12 June 2019,4,6

GOT has over the years brilliantly built people's stories only for the end to leave the question ""what was the point?""
John Snows lineage in the end - pointless. Why did no one mention who his parents were while deciding who should rule?
John Snow is basically the biggest hero most of the way through - saving the day and doing the right thing but in the end he gets shafted in the worst most boring way.
Cersei needed to be murdered - we as viewers deserved a bit of justice. She goes out with a whimper!!
Where on earth did Bran go in the battle with the white walkers?? ""I'm going now""! Oh are you Bran - where exactly...????
Was this Bran's plan all along, to manipulate his way to the throne?? We don't know because they didn't tell us.
I can only assume that the adventures of Arya is going to be one of the spin offs - otherwise her ending has no purpose.I gave it 2* and not 1 because I can actually get on board with what happens to Danaerys and Sansa they both got what they deserved in the end for different reasons.

Tyrion for once looked smart and wise concerning the new king , justifying his character development. The dialogues were carefully written , unlike the rest of season 8. Beautiful scenes of the dragon raising his wings as khaleesi approaches her army , John petting ghost, throne melting. All characters got their natural closure.Sansa became queen in the north , Arya started new travelling experiences , John back to nights watch with tormound and ghost . Brienne writing down the history of ser Jeimy. Podrick a night . Bronn got his castle.Could it be better ? It could've been MUCH better, yes. Would I wish a remake for season 8. I would. With more episodes and better pacing. But fortunately, I felt like episode 6 was a great closure that justifies most of the characters' development. Would've been unfair to rate the episode low just because I didn't get exactly who I wanted to rule. As long as every character stays true to his character development and there are no loose ends , I'm very happy.9/10 for the amazing performances by all actors, old school well written dialogues , beautiful cinematography and a justified fulfilling end to every character developed.",9,21 May 2019,4,6

2890,"It is sad not because I didnt get what I wanted as a viewer, not because the writers hit a soft spot in my morality. It's sad because the plot was rushed and preachy, the characters well seemed out of character and that one of the biggest enemies of humanity that symbolizes one the biggest existential issue of mankind was dealt as if it was nothing more of a joke.Anyway... Shame.. dunno what was going in their minds and I understand how easy it is to sit here at the comfort and risk free environment of my home and criticize other people works but damn... the filmmakers of the story must understand that GoT was about the experience of actually being part of the game, the game of thrones not about teaching us about morality.Exposition over substance this season was. It should have been the other way around...",3,20 May 2019,4,6

With the buildup of the series, with the potential for complex
endings and with the storylines being so interesting, and a budget
with no ending, THIS is what the writers came up with?THIS ...garbage.... there is no drama, its like chewing old gum
and there is no flavour, no interesting sideplots, nothing, it is a straight
lukewarm ending that seems so rushed and so predictable that even
a child could have come up with a unicorn ending rather than this
drawnout farewell to beloved characters.It was so predictable, so unlike GOT that I am angry over the lack
of vision from the writers, producers, and how could the cast be okey
with their scripts, its sad, its boring, its like watching 90000th episode
of SOAP (old tv series).Queen Sansa like she always strived to be
John out in the wilderness like he always wanted to be a sorrowful bitter man
Arya out exploring the world like she always does.Nothing changed, nothing, it was so boring I actually for the first time
was looking forward to the ending of the episode because I had enough
of the rewind all the time.Now they plan to come out with a prequel, snooooooore, who the bloody
cares about a prequel when everyone knows how it ends. IN BOREDOM!!",3,20 May 2019,4,6
2892,I called a happy ever after ending to this after the first episode and I was right. The Game of Thrones was not built on happy endings. Its what made it a great show. There were so many loose ends that it requires at least another 2 seasons of 10 episodes to wind them all up.A fitting end for this show would have been the Night King on the Throne. The winner should have been death!But I am glad it is finished and we can wait for the books.,3,20 May 2019,4,6
2893,Terrible end to a once great show. The whole of season 8 made no sense. Bran becoming king was laughable. Jon snow banished to the nights watch? Nights watch....? Why still have a nights watch?

2900,"I am glad I read the reddit spoilers ahead of time. Knowing what was in store gave me the chance to compose myself and watch this ending as if it were a parody. But even knowing the major plot points ahead of time, didn't prepare me for how utterly awful this conclusion to GoT was.I found myself laughing hysterically at the illogical, uncharacteristic, rushed events that occured. The golden hand sticking out of the rubble, so Tyrion would know exactly where to look, Grey Worm suddenly appearing ahead of Jon through a terrible cut, when he just left him behind after he killed the Lannister men, Arya really not caring anymore who lives or dies (she seems almost bored), Jon on the other hand being so whimsical that it hurts, Dany suddenly without guards and absolutely no one in sight, Dany not realising the man she is hugging to her chest is drawing a dagger, Drogon burning walls and the throne but not Dany's murderer, the Unsullied not killing Jon on the spot when he admitted to the murder off screen, the beards that grow and vanish again from one scene to the next, the magical clean up and rebuild ""in who knows how much time has passed anymore?"", the lackluster council to make Bran king, the bad CGI when Jon finally pets Ghost, and so much more.I am so looking forward to Martin's final books, because he at least knows that the journey is the reward. His books will have an excess length that will tie all the knots up nicely. Nothing rushed, nothing as bad as the battle of Winterfell (stratigically and without any real major deaths), hopefully no Brienne Jaime disaster, etc.",1,20 May 2019,4,6
2901,"I will start with what I liked about the final episode. Cinematography was truly outstanding. The scene where Dany walks out to speak to her armies with Drogon behind her is one of the best scenes I have ever seen in my entire life. Also the throne room looked absolutely breathtaking. The cast performances were truly outstanding as always. However the writing was quite a disappointment. The entire season felt rushed and did not make much sense in the way it was delivered. I believe a lot of the stuff that happened could be considered good writing if there was enough time to build up on them. The season definitely needed more episodes to be able to build up on this conclusion. I was happy to see all the characters together once again when voting for the new king, but also I would have liked to see a few of them speak a bit more. I like that some of the characters got what they wanted but I don't particularly like that almost all characters got what they wanted. It seems a lot like fan service and quite disconnected to the previous seasons. Overall the writing in this episode was not my least favourite of the season but considering the writing in episode 5 was an utter disappointment, I feel that we needed a lot more from this episode to salvage the season. GoT has been the show of outstanding writing and storytelling and it is quite disappointing to see such a mediocre writing on the grand finale. To finish on a positive note, congratulations to the cast and crew for the outstanding performances, breathtaking cinematography and beautiful music, really well done.",4,20 May 2019,4,6

But the last one... The biggest problem is time, just 6 episodes... As Martin said the reason he leaves, that he wants to make this about 5 more seasons, so that should be at least 10 or 11 season with 10 full epsidodes each. Srls? John and his Targaryan heritage was so important and nothing? He backs to night watch? Dany died like this? Bran is a king? Night king was killed in one episode?

I feel like writers literally played with loyal fans who followed the series from 10 years.Why was Jon image build up by bringing him back to life and revealing his secret. Why was Arya stark trained all her life. She did not use her faceless assasin skill in last season at all. May be writers forget that she had that skill.Jon deserved better(everyone will agree to this). The scene where all the masters meet to discuss who will rule the seven kingdom is a joke and destroys every fan.Dothraki and unsullied were waiting for masters to arrive. They did not take any actions and waited patiently even after their queen was murdered. So like Dothrakis, they are so patient humans.Other way to end the show:
1. Cercie should have got killed by Arya by hiding with the face of Qyburn
2. Jon should have become the King by killing Dany
3. Bran should have been the hand of the king
4. Jon's truth should have got revealed to everyone

No, the North must be independent because Northmen died fighting in the war. Evidently the men from all the other regions that died fighting in the war are less-than (less huffing and more asking for the Vale's independence Sweetrobin!).Congrats also on ruining Jon Snow's character, although I supposed he started as moppy brooder and ended as a moppy brooder. And why did he have to go to the wall protecting the kingdoms from nothing? To appease the Unsullied you say? Well, they just ferried themselves back to Essos so they're out.

Good thing he came back from the dead and had a whole royal lineage story developed over several seasons so he could not be bothered to fight for his own life, let alone the throne.This whole season was so painfully rushed as to make it unrecognizable. At so many points in this series people would just be walking from point-A to point-B, and in that time we would see them talking, growing, encountering problems and overcoming them. All throughout this last season suddenly it feels like people can just teleport across the realm when it suits the tremendously, astonishingly rushed plot. And we lose all of that great and subtle development while people are on their journeys, rather than oh hey, everything has to happen in basically 4 episodes.Honestly why even make it if you're going to rush through so fast?

2954,"Ok. Until what I'll say below proves to be true (books soon to come), my 6 stars rating stays.
Everything we saw in the first few scenes are Jon and Tyrion's POV. I think Dany was misunderstood. Often one is labeled as being MAD in this case.
Tyrion's valyrian is bad so what he understood from that speech is unreliable. Jon doesn't know valyrian at all. He gets manipulated into killing Dany mainly by Tyrion who thinks he is on death row. Only Dany never places anyone in chains. If she wants somebody dead, ""dracarys!"" and that's it. Jon even has to leave his sword behind before seeing Tyrion. Why ? Afraid he would kill a person who Dany wants dead ? Go ahead then. Except Dany did not want Tyrion dead. He is alive later in the episode for the same reason.
Anyway, one misunderstanding after the other which leads to Dany being murdered. Then Drogon burns the Iron Throne. Now let me say it here: That's no longer Drogon. It's Daenerys. That's why Jon is not burned and the throne is not ""a dumb bystandard cought in the conflagration"" but it's on purpose destroyed by Dany. I now wait for the books on this one.
Second half of the episode I ignore. Except for the ""it doesn't feel right dialog""- that kind of gives me hope that what I wrote is true - and the ""history is subjective"" scenes as I call them.
History really is subjective - What Brienne wrote in The White Book, Tyrion is not mentioned in A Song of Ice and Fire and so on. That's why we have 2 names for the same thing: ""Robert's Rebbelion"" and ""War of the Usurper"".

2995,"This season has been a real disappointment! I disagreed with a lot of the hate but then again lots of it was justified. Bran is on the throne for doing absolutely nothing every season. How do you justify him as having the biggest story ? He's not done anything towards the cause. He was all high and mighty and didn't show feeling or a hunger for power and then he just completely changes his tune. The white walkers were absolutely useless, you make them the biggest threat and yet they die in one major battle. The knight king should be on the throne.",1,20 May 2019,4,6

Hope this will be the start of the downfall for people like those ... Really did not expect that of a tragedy in writing a simple story ...

2998,I started watching GoT in 2011.. saw a lot of good characters developed and some very very good storyline developed as well. But man the finale was such a disappointment. I thought Dexter and Lost had bad endings but GoT beat them to it. There was no logic at all in some of the scenes.. when Jon killed Daenerys why will Greyworm simply ok imprison him? Why wouldn't he attack him with rage? So silly,1,20 May 2019,4,6

3033,"This final episode had great acting, great production values, but, oh, that writing! Dany just turns on a dime into the ""dragon lady""? I get where they are going with all of these characters, but they just went there too fast. Hey, D&D that rushed woke writing style will serve you well at Disney where they seem to ruin everything they touch. First the good - Drogon mourning Dany, Tyrion mourning his dead evil siblings. Now the bad. Grey worm only has one expression - a grimace. Tyrion is a prisoner who is told he is not there to speak and then winds up making a speech that determines the outcome of the series?? Oh, and he picks the new king too! Jon is given a life sentence but in a place where nobody really knows if he stays or goes? And the unsullied are going to be happy with Green Acres when they had their heart set on fighting an unending war?Well, at least Arya's arc turned out OK. She becomes an explorer and sails off the edge of the maps until she finds a vast continent with the remains of a statue of a lady holding a torch stuck in the sands of a beach. She would have stayed there but for the odd lone inhabitant who keeps going on about prying something ""from my cold dead hands"". Annoyed by this person, she sails back to Westeros, never to speak of the place again.",5,25 May 2019,7,13
3034,"A strange troll army seems to have taken over IMDB. Yes - the ending is a bit rushed but the final episode clearly deserves more than 1 point. The ending is a typical George RR Martin ending and everyone who is surprises by it, has never paid attention. Every little bit of it, was clearly set up, beginning with episode 1. The beginning matches exactly with the ending, including the jouney north of the wall and the Kingslayer who tried to kill the true (later) King in Episode 1, by kicking him out of the window. It was never a story about the nightking and white walkers, it was always a story about the game around the throne and the family Stark and the wonderful Tyrion. In the end truely everyone got what he or she deserved.",10,22 May 2019,7,13

3036,"Totally anticlimactic way to end the show; it basically ended how it ""should have"" and very predictable the whole season through; in other words this is not game of thrones fashion.

3041,"Unlike pretty much everyone else on here, I thought the entire episode (just like the rest of Season 8) was perfect. I loved the fact that all the 'big moments' were more artfully done, rather than simply just going for big, brash shocking moments. Most of the 'big moments', such as, Arya killing the Night King, Jon killing Danaerys, Cersei and Jamie dying in each other's arms were storytelling at their best. The directors/writers let the music, imagery and basically just the moment take over. Theon Greyjoy going out the way he did to that music...WOW! I realise most people won't agree, but where is moaning so much going to get you? Yes, the writers didn't conclude it the way 'you wanted it to be concluded', but that's their prerogative. Thanks GoT for the last 8 years. It has been wonderful!p.s. Thank you so much for making Bronn a good guy in the end. Please allow him to build his brothel.",10,20 May 2019,7,13

3044,"Ludicrous. Absurd. Disappointing. I am truly devastated and distraught over how D&D decided to conclude this masterpiece. The storytelling is another level of bad and I can honestly admit that I will never watch another episode of this series again, knowing how it ends. They managed to completely destroy every single character and it truly saddens me.In an interview D&D admitted to not reading reviews, particularly, in their opinion, the ""negative"" ones. In conclusion, they won't have to live with the crime of ruining an entire series and fandom. Shame on you D&D!",1,20 May 2019,7,13

3050,"I seriously feel insulted by this ending. How dumb do D&D think we are? That we're just going to be happy with this trainwreck? I feel betrayed by the writing. I honestly do. These characters in this season were not the characters I learned to love over the course of 7 seasons. This sad excuse for a finale is overflowing with disappointments. I'm not upset it wasn't the conclusion I had envisioned, I'm upset that they sacrificed the integrity of the show for shock value.
I was rooting for Dany the entire series. I watched her mature, develop, succeed, fail, love, grieve, and grow for 8 years. For 8 years I had been waiting for her to win back the Iron Throne like the badass she became. Then I'm ""oh no she's crazy we can't let her win"" two episodes before the finale? Is this a joke? I'm not angry that it didn't pan out the way I had hoped, I'm angry that they ruined her character to finish the show. The Dany I know is not the Dany that burned down King's Landing. That's not Dany. That was a once powerful woman reduced to a stock character because the writers don't understand pacing.
I'm heart broken. I really am. I genuinely have a pain in my chest. I don't recognize my favorite show anymore. It was once so well written. Everything happened for a reason, and lead to a consequence. The plot was so air tight. I'm appalled.",1,20 May 2019,7,13
3051,"I was at a loss for words when I finished watching the final episode. It's absolutely horrendous. I'd give it a 0 if I could.This season was already so dreadful, but this, this is the lowest of the lows. Most things in the episode make zero sense.Jon Snow being Aegon Targaryen and the rightful heir to the throne doesn't seem to matter apparently. One of the biggest build-ups of the show and it was all undone because he killed the ""queen"". He's still the rightful heir to the throne, and even if Jon slaughtered cities, or murdered any ""queen"" or ""king"", it still doesn't change the fact that he's the rightful heir and absolutely no one has the right to imprison the rightful heir. How does that make any sense at all?Bran saying ""Why do you think I came all this way"" legitimately made me want to throw up. Everything about that made no sense because it just goes completely against the character's nature.Why is there a night's watch anymore? What on earth is the point?
These are just some of the many things that defy logic in this atrocious final episode.I'm actually dumbfounded that professional writers couldn't see how atrocious this was and how little sense any of it made.",1,20 May 2019,7,13

I laughed so hard at the incoherences. I felt like watching a Hollywood summer movie, stupid and funny. And now I know the names of the screen writers so I will never watch something these two guys are in. As a Star Wars fan that hurts but I have no choice. I will never watch the new Star Wars.

3110,"Multiple scenes from this episode didn't make any sense, at all. First of all, Why did Drogon carry Daenerys away? we already know that once a dragons rider dies, the dragons finds another dragonrider to bond with, this happened multiple times with the biggest known dragon, Balerion, which is mentioned (and shown; the skull at least) in the show, why wouldn't he bond with Jon, it wasn't because he killed Daenerys, we know that Maegor the first killed other Targaryens, that didn't stop Baelerion from bonding with him.Secondly, i have never in my live, laughed harder than when Bran answered Tyrion ""why do you think i've come so far?"" or something close to that, i don't remember word for word, can't be bothered rewatching to find out, it is THAT bad.
So his focus has to be on learning the history, which is also why he refuses to be lord, or anything, yet he accepts the crown, with a witty comment?????? The writers have shown that they cannot write a good show if there lives depended on it, ever since the show couldn't rely on the rich, beautiful, amazingly well-written story from GRRM, it has gone downhill, and this season, especially this last episode, even with it's massive budget, almost made me fall asleep.The third thing is, why would Sansa ever accept Jons sentence, she literally just said that she, and the north will never bow again, and that she wanted him freed, she even threatened with the northern army 2 minutes before?? but then.... she... changed her mind i guess? for some reason?I hope to forget season 7 and 8. The entire season feels rushed, but this episode takes the cake, it doesn't just contradicts the entire show, but it manages to twist it, from a never-seen-before show, where the viewers never know who dies or who lives, into a melodramatic romance/drama basic tv show, so sad.",1,20 May 2019,9,18

3112,"I never write reviews but I need to defend this episode! I do not understand why people are so upset with the ending. Firstly, throughout the whole series Dany says she will take what is hers with ""fire and blood"" hence ep 5. She's become her father, she's THE MAD QUEEN. Dany is a tragic character who started with good intentions and descended into insanity with power and the loss of her closest friends. I'm so impressed the writers had the courage to give us this ending to her character even though it was sad.
Next, stability could only ever be brought to the seven (now 6) kingdoms with a democracy. Drogon melting the iron throne was symbolic of that.
Cersei will forever be forgotten but Jaime is remembered.
And finally, the way they finished Jon, Sansa and Arya's storylines was perfect. Sansa was always meant to be a queen, Arya is not a lady and Jon is back where he'll be happiest with Ghost.
I think people who are unhappy with the ending have completely missed the point of the show. No one is forcing them to watch it! Let the fans who enjoyed the ending enjoy it. HBO are not going to remake it. :)",10,20 May 2019,26,65

3114,"It is absolutely ridiculous just how much hate and negativity this show has been getting the past few episodes, this one in particular. I mean, what did you guys expect to happen. Just because it didn't go how you wanted it to? That's the point to writing a good ending. It is one you don't expect. Tyrion said it best. ""We are all connected by stories"". But every story must end and will end how it chooses to end, not you. Thank you Game of Thrones for not listening to the criticism of dimwitted crybabies and adapting a story that has been dear to all of us. I hope these haters will come to realize the blissfulness and sense of completion that this episode brings and just enjoy it for what it is. Thanks for this grand conclusion GoT.

3117,"The 1/10 reviews are full of it.
You simply can't review this a 1 star.
Mostly because the performances/camera work/cgi were amazing as always.The problem is not with this events happening it's how they are happening. This season was really rushed to the point that nothing the characters ever did was earned. I just didn't feel it. I'm fine with Daenerys being Mad Queen and I'm fine with the fact that Jon killed her. But it was so rushed that I didn't feel for a single moment that se was ""Mad"". Even her death was so unsatisfying. If she has to die as a mad queen make it feel earned. That she actually deserved it.On the other way Bran being the King is complete trash. He was always to me the ""boring storyline"" He had a couple of moments but overall I never really liked his story arc . Especially when he became the three eyed Raven and started the whole ""I'm not Bran anymore "" thing. But I can tell you that he could be a GREAT master of whispers.
I was never rooting for Jon or Danny to be the ruler but this was even worse. Again it didn't feel earned.Who has a better story than Bran the Broken? Well...every single main character.If this was their endgame they should have handle it better.Overall the episode had some great moments.
Some of them were The shot with drogon's wings behind Dany.
Tyrion saying goodbye at his siblings was good .
Arya and Sansa had a fitting ending.I do not think it that it was a waste of time . At least for me. 3 or 4 episodes don't cancel the entire show which for the most parts seasons 1-7 were really Masterpieces. Im gonna keep suggesting people to watch it. The end of an era.
Thank you to all the people that worked hard on this.",6,21 May 2019,17,40

Looking over these reviews and the ridiculous reaction by most to what was an ending to a show for goodness sake's, all I could think about was the film adaptation of the Stephen King novel MISERY.

3131,"How I wish it never ended. There would be so much more to say, but:I love the fact that it is a finale with parallelisms. I love the parallelism of events in the history of Westeros. The Iron Throne (the wheel) was forged by fire and blood by Aegon Targaryen and a dragon, and would eventually be destroyed by fire and blood by another Aegon Targaryen and another dragon: In the year 1 AC Aegon the Conqueror forged The Iron Throne by blood (with the swords of the enemies he defeated) with Balerion's fire (who melted them). Centuries later, Aegon Targaryen, by blood (killing Daenerys), and Drogon, also by fire, would put an end to the very same throne and the very same wheel, breaking it once and for all. It is just brilliant storytelling. And now we know what Jon Snow was brought back to life for.Watching Drogon taking Daenerys' body and disappearing with her in a sky full of ashes is just dream-like, beautiful, and tragic. Truly an otherworldly vision. One of the most stunning and moving scenes I've ever seen.Emilia Clarke's performance as the queen of ashes is nothing short of magnificent. The nuances conveyed by her performance as she sinks deeper and deeper in her messiah complex, unable to realize what she has done, are amazing and heart-wrenching to watch.The shot of Daenerys with Drogon's wings behind her, as if they were hers, is breathtakingly genius.Sam suggesting to the noble men that the new king should be elected not only by the high born but also by the common people. It just shows, as everyone laughs at him, what a visionary and how much ahead of his time he was.The twins who were born together and died together on each others arms. It is just tragically poetic.Arya Stark. A perfect closure to her character. One can't help but wonder what adventures would be waiting for her. The noble girl who refused to be a lady. The girl who refused to be a girl and became a trained assassin, saving the living from the dead. The assassin who avenged her family and almost lost herself along the way. The assassin who was saved by the man she once swore to kill. The nomad who wouldn't settle down but would always be Arya Stark of Winterfell.

For this episode, I'll admit, there were some good scenes, such as Drogon and Daenerys' last scene and how he melts the Iron Throne. I also kinda liked it when Brienne wrote about Jaime in the Book of Brothers. Arya looking for what's west of Westeros also makes sense. They did right by her, it wouldn't be believable if she stayed in King's Landing.But what they did to Jon's character, it's an absolute shame. All of a sudden no one cares about him being a Targaryen anymore? No one blinked an eye when Dany burned all those innocent people apparently? How are the Unsullied and the Dothraki not all dead? Didn't seem like Dany was careful about avoiding them when she was burning the city down. How are so many of them even still alive after The Long Night? How could Dany even think that Jon would be slightly okay with what she did? I could see Dany going mad, but it all seemed so rushed. As well as their romance. How did anyone find out that it was Jon who killed Dany, when Drogon took her body and no one's really sure where he is? Why did they make Bran king? What's that awkward moment with Edmure Tully about? And why is he even there? How are Jaime and Cersei not buried under a thousand kilos of bricks? They looked quite alright, and if they stepped a few feet to the right, it looks like they might have still lived. How is the Great Hall still intact? Doesn't look nearly as destroyed as it should. Why in the world is Bronn made Master of Coin? Because he threatened Tyrion and Jaime back in Winterfell?There's just too many questions unanswered.Wish this season (and why not season 7 as well while we're at it) could be remade but that is very very unlikely. As a loyal watcher I just feel betrayed, many GoT fans with me.Though, a massive thanks to the actors, George, visual effects crew, camera crew, crew who designed the costumes and the set and everyone else who worked so hard on this show for so many years.",1,20 May 2019,6,11

What's the payoff?Jon goes back to being an unimportant dude living north of the wall. What was the point of his parentage reveal anyway? To serve as a catalyst for the deterioration of Daenerys' mental health? So it was literally a plot device that meant nothing for Jon himself. Pathetic. Bran's journey and story arc with the night walkers and the night king was for absolutely nothing. Just another plot hole left uncovered. Arya just.... leaves. We don't know if she'll ever come back to Winterfell, if she'll ever see her sister again. We don't know. The writers didn't kill her but they didn't know what to do with her, so they decided, 'cool, let's make her travel the world alone!' I feel like she deserved better. Another one who deserved better? Daenerys. The last pure-blood Targaryen. The last dragon. Killed as if she was nothing in the dumbest way. And they didn't even let her dragon avenge her. He just... flies away. With her body. And by the way, where did he take her? We don't know, we'll never know, because the writers cared so little about a character that has been central to this story for years, that they didn't even bother to tell us what happened next. Now there's a dragon on the loose with nobody to look after him. Fantastic. That's surely gonna end well. Then Bran becomes king. Wow. Where did that come from? A guy who until a few episodes ago said he couldn't even the king of Winterfell because he was ""something else now"", and all of a sudden, he's on board with the idea of becoming the king of the 6 kingdoms? I kept waiting for his eyes to turn blue so maybe some of it would make sense. But that twist never came. Tyrion being named hand of the king just keeps the power with the Lannisters anyway. And to be honest Tyrion stopped being an interesting character when he joined Daenerys. He isn't smart anymore and half the things that happened since he returned to Westeros with the Targaryen armies would have been avoided had he used his once incredible brain. Brienne's final moments were used to prop up Jaime's character, not her own. The only character that arguably got a decent ending was Sansa. But even that didn't feel earned, considering how bad she was written this season.The characters end exactly where they were in the beginning (in Daenerys' case, she ends her journey in an even worse way). The writers were so worried about shocking us and avoiding a ""happy"" ending, that they forgot all about writing a satisfying end to the character's stories.

I have a special kind of hatred for D&D for the level of audacity they have to show disrespect to women in power. Cersei, Arya, Sansa and Dany wow a whole lot pride and power but who is the king ? Bran the Broken my friend. Every character were inconsistent with their DNA in this season their words didnt mean anything every line said had no background. Everyone knows that John is the rightful heir so if he killed Dany how can you punish a King ? John is basically that employee who gets fckd by everyone in office and says absolutely nothing. Drogon should have burned John for killing Dany that would hve been a fitting end to the collossal spineless jack ass John Snow. So Bran knew he was going to be the king when he replies to Tyrion 'why do you think I came this far' that means he is equally responsible for the fate of kings landing and he is the king just wow. Writers really took a year of naps while writing. They did not work they just slept. The summary of GOT is that women should never be in power and the deserving never gets to the position of power. This show could hve been an inspiration if it showed a new direction but instead it chose to stay afoot in current situation the very reality of todays world. I will not recommend this show to anyone in future its a legacy that should be forgotten.",1,20 May 2019,6,11

I have read through most of the theories published about this final series, which ofcourse where superior to this season. Frankly, this season has been disastrous by all means. I really did try to enjoy the season. First two eposides were good, building up for a hardcore battle. Well the third, that one was an epic battle, brutal and gripping. Yet the ending ruined it for me. Seven seasons of build up and prophecies, which made me think of an extraordinary ending, but instead I was faced by a rather absurd and unbelievable one. The fourth and fifth eposide went more downhill. I tried to blink my eye to the flaws, but well, this this eposide I couldn't. Mere stupidness. Writing at its worst. Stupid conversations, and characters acting out of character. David and Dan really managed to damage something beautiful here.

3176,"We all loved GoT for its realism. No matter how many dragons were flying in the skies of Westeros, no matter how many dead walkers were going through the Wall, the saga has always been very much true to life. And there are two things about life we know quite well: it's unpredictable and it's seldom fair.
It isn't important how we live, it isn't important who our parents are - our lives rarely have sense and our deaths frequently have no reason or consequence. In other words, it's 'Valar Morgulis', and that is what GoT has always been about. If you don't see it, no hard feelings, you're blind.
It's not about the fight for the Iron Throne, which is just a simulacrum, a fetish that has sense only because it's made sense of. But it's about us: fools and cowards, heroes and adventurers, betrayers and lovers ready to do everything needed to save ourselves and get what we want. And on the way to the aim may happen anything. In that respect D&D's script seems to me quite logical and growing up from GRRM lifeview.
'Night King died too fast', you say. 'Cersei deserves a more terrible death', you say. Okay, then make a petition to the UNO because Hitler's death was too easy and we do deserve an epic battle between him and Zhukov, don't we?
'What Daenerys did with King's Landing has no sense', you say. Okay, then explain to the world what sense Dresden massacre in 1945 had. Or what was the point of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Were they necessary indeed? Helpful? Reasonable at least? Don't the Alliance leaders deserve punishment for these bloody pages of the world's history?
That's what GoT is. Not a tale, but a story. It's not about how things could have gone if people have been less stupid or less principled, if they had given more love or respect to each other, it's about how things are going because life is life and people are people. Not a piece of didactism, but a piece of reality, due to which the finale is even better than it could be predicted.
The only drawback is how rapidly things go in s07 and s08. And I find it the only (though the crucial) D&D's mistake. For two seasons and 14 episodes they tell us a story that should have been at least 4 seasons and 40 episodes long (as I personally feel it). Too many things have remained unshown. Too many characters' changes have to be overinterpreted. Too many motives have been left behind the scenes. For sure the watchers have deserved a story chewed over in a more thorough way - the way, we got used to in earlier seasons. And it takes 0.5 points out of this undoubted masterpiece. Neither more nor less.",10,20 May 2019,6,11

There will be posts that go into details of each scene, something that I need not do but rather submit my huge disappointment of this season finale as one of the worst pieces of writing ever.I cannot even find the words to describe how pathetic the Jon Snow character arc was handled. Here is a character that saved the thousands, maybe millions from death and despair only to be portrayed and treated as a war criminal and then to be sent to the Night's Watch? Are you serious, the Night's Watch? It still exists and all of the great minds of Westeros believe they still need one? Jon Snow, the War Criminal ... completely pathetic. Also, how many times did he say ""She's Our Queen""? I am so sick of those 3 words.The death of Daenerys was so bad. I think of all of the amazing scenes, character development and emotional ups and downs we could have experienced if they spent the time to develop these complex characters and relationships with real and talented writers. GOT should have been a minimum of 10 seasons and perhaps even 11 or 12.Now it is time for King Bran, all hail King Bran! Such an amazing character in the first few seasons and to resolve his character arc in a basic and simplistic road to the throne. When did he earn it? When was his struggle ever synonymous with the road to ruling? Where was the emotional release of resolution? There was none because it was meaningless to us. There was no release.I am so happy that this season and series is over. I will not miss this show. Had you of told me 2 months ago that I would feel this way I would have told you that you are crazy.I think most everyone who committed and loved GOT has huge admiration for the actors great performance, the set design people, makeup, costume people, stunt doubles, CGI experts and behind the scene personnel.

Yes, democratic election makes sense. Logically he would have been the one but no. Also, the unsullied are gone as are the dothraki.

3189,"Phase 1: Question
1. What was the point of Azor Ahai? How can you leave all of those characters believe they did it for the Lord of Light and kill the subplot? Melissandre, Beric Dondarrion, Thoros of Myr, the entire Brotherhood without Banners, Stannis, Jon Snow (after revival), Daenarys and all the red priestess?
2. What was the Night King objective? ... Bran Stark: ""He wants to kill me because I am the memory of this world, it's history""... Well, la di da Bran, you haven't said more than 2 lines per episode, your history is either dead or silent.
3. Why did Jon get the short straw? The one true king, the whole subplot that he is the right man for the throne since the characters learn the truth about him it's tossed out the window?
4. What happened with the Dothraki and the rest of the Unsullied that stayed?
5. How the hell, did Bronn became the Master of Coin since in the second season he didn't knew how a loan works?
6. Why Sansa is such a despicable character? ""I love you brother, but I thought they were going to vote for me as queen, so anyway I will be Queen in the North""
7. How is Bran better suited for King than Jon? Jon is proven warrior and battle commander, he has more experience in ruling and he is a bloody Targaryen and a Stark >>> HE IS ICE AND FIRE. So WHY?Phase 2: Trying to get the magic back
I burst into laughter when Tyrion reminded Jon ""What about your sisters?"" somehow a parallel between Varys and Ned Stark back in S1 ""What about your daughters?""... but here it was not dramatic, it was a joke, that he needed a reminder about who he loved the most.
It's shameful what they have done with this series. What was the point of Jon having a moral compass after Dany scorched King's Landing?

EVERY character development was thrown in the garbage can.I don't know where to start.Tyrion became a fool, a shadow of himself in the last two, three seasons. A real shame. The showrunners simply couldn't replicate the witty, sarcastic, acid lines and ideas from the original writing. There was no wisdom in that head, just a well-meaning fool trying to go on. Remember the Tyrion from his own Trial, back in Season 4? That guy is gone, nowhere to be seen.Jaime was back to square one in a single episode. He thrown everything away to save Cersei and go back being a lapdog. I lack the time to expose everything wrong with such decision. And Cersei's death? The most anticlimactic piece of garbage ever? A stupid death that could be avoided giving some steps to the side?And Jon? My, what a disaster. Why bring him back after all? A complete useless buffon, with nothing to say and a sad, crying face all the time. His heritage was useless, and at the most considered a subplot to annoy Dany. Acted like a stupid hound with no purpose but go back to square one, as Jaime did.Dany? This is abhorrent. She had little ""hints"" of ""blood and fire"" before, but EVERY DIFFICULT DECISION was faced with hesitation, sadness and conflict. She never killed innocents without mercy, without thought, just for the heck of it. She could become a ""dark queen"", but in a whole season of development, suffering and breaking. Not two episodes. Just stupid, nothing more than stupid.Then, Dany is killed by Jon after a sloppy dialogue with Tyrion. Drogon DOES NOT KILL JON! For some reason. And, of course, he was arrested in the background by unsullied that should kill him on the spot, probably because he confessed the killing even when no one saw it. The guy is lost. A completely dumb character.Well, and this goes for everyone else. Bronn, Sam, Arya, etc.What about the ""council"", or ""circus"" made to choose the king? Was it parody? I thought it was parody, or a bad joke. Stupid lines, stupid dialogue, asinine decisions. Bran, the King? Totally destroying the purpose of the Three Eyed Raven that refused Winterfell a while before? Oh, and he was utterly useless beyond one or two gossips here and there. People DIED so he could be something else. And for what?Edmure being treated like a clown? Cat would love it. Sam acted like a complete fool asking for democracy, but the same people that laughed about it LISTENED TO THE PRISONER IN CHAINS!!! ""Let's chose our kings and end hereditary rule"". Easy. It's something worthy of a low-key comedy or something. And don't start me about the ""independent"" north. Dorne and the Iron Islands would follow suit immediately, if any reason were used here.So, Jon is sent north, to the Night's Watch. That wasn't a part of the now ""Six Kingdoms"", since Sansa proclaimed independence, but let's forget about it. And
that the NW serves no purpose anymore. No. Purpose. Except, as Tyrion said, as a kind of exile for outlaws. My, did I say that the ending was stupid? And with the permission of Gray Worm, of course. The, say, 3 to 5 thousand remaining unsullied were a force to be reckoned by the ""council"" for some reason.And, to the gran finale, the new Small Council. It was borderline offensive. A bunch of fools talking nonsense, with an almost dead king. A joke. A cruel, mean joke. The curtains end after showing Jon going further north with some wildlings. Could be poetic and nice, if not by the abyssal execution.Please, Martin, let it be an insidious ploy to sell more books to the eager reader with some vain hope left.

There was no way this show was going to give us the perfect conclusion, not after it began rushing toward that conclusion. The first ten minutes of tonight's series finale should have been the last ten minutes of this season's finale, with another season in the offing detailing the fight of Jon Snow and the other rebel Lords and Ladies against the tyrant Dragon Queen.Instead, it's all over, with so much story left untold. In an ideal world, Season 7 should have been 10 episodes setting up the conflict with the Night King. Season 8 should have been another 10 episodes resolving that conflict and setting up the showdown with Cersei, as well as further establishing Daenerys as a dangerous, mentally unhinged conqeuror. And Season 9 should have been the evisceration of Cersei and King's Landing and the fight against this new Queen of the Ashes, out to liberate all of humankind, through blood and fire.x

The first ten minutes of tonight's series finale should have been the last ten minutes of this season's finale, with another season in the offing detailing the fight of Jon Snow and the other rebel Lords and Ladies against the tyrant Dragon Queen.Instead, it's all over, with so much story left untold. In an ideal world, Season 7 should have been 10 episodes setting up the conflict with the Night King. Season 8 should have been another 10 episodes resolving that conflict and setting up the showdown with Cersei, as well as further establishing Daenerys as a dangerous, mentally unhinged conqeuror. And Season 9 should have been the evisceration of Cersei and King's Landing and the fight against this new Queen of the Ashes, out to liberate all of humankind, through blood and fire.
""What about all the other people,"" Jon Snow asks his queen, ""Who think they know what's good?""""They don't get a choice,"" Dany responds, thrusting a knife into her own heart in the process, though she doesn't realize it until it's too late. Jon Snow has executed conspirators, true, but he's never been one to go out and save the world by taking away other peoples' choice. That's not freedom or liberation, and while Jon hasn't ever really been much of a liberator, either, he's always had a sense of right and wrong. Dany (and Grey Worm) have lost sight of that. Or, rather, Dany never quite realized that the means to an end still matter. To her, the ends were the only thing that held any meaning at all.

The final episode of 'Game of Thrones just aired. It's definitely going to make some people mad.CREDIT: HBOGame Of Thrones is over. The world's most popular show, based on one of my very favorite fantasy series ever written, has aired its last episode.It was . . . pretty good, too. In 80 minutes, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss wrapped up a show that's spanned eight seasons, two continents, seven Houses and hundreds of thousands of corpses, and they did a decent job at it, considering. There was no way this show was going to give us the perfect conclusion, not after it began rushing toward that conclusion.

""What about all the other people,"" Jon Snow asks his queen, ""Who think they know what's good?""""They don't get a choice,"" Dany responds, thrusting a knife into her own heart in the process, though she doesn't realize it until it's too late.

That's not freedom or liberation, and while Jon hasn't ever really been much of a liberator, either, he's always had a sense of right and wrong. Dany (and Grey Worm) have lost sight of that. Or, rather, Dany never quite realized that the means to an end still matter. To her, the ends were the only thing that held any meaning at all.So much in this episode would have been truly great if we'd just gotten here more naturally. Jon's resistance to Tyrion's common sense discussion about Daenerys and the threat she poses the world might have made sense if Jon and Dany's relationship had been even half as convincing as Jon and Ygritte's. If he'd truly loved her, I could understand his unwillingness to hear Tyrion's truths. But there's nothing about Jon Snow's character that would defend Daenerys in this situation. He clearly believed that what she did was wrong, that what she described in her speech to the Unsullied and Dothraki was abhorrent, the words of a self-deluded megalomaniac.
If the show had convinced me that he truly loved her with an undying passion, that his love would truly overshadow his reason, his duty, then okay. This scene would have felt earned. Instead I wanted to slap Jon in the face and shake him and tell him to stop being so bloody stupid!
his is the denouement we've all been wondering about. What happens when the final boss is dead, when the show has to wrap up its many threads? Well, let's see . . .
Tyrion comes before a smattering of nobles- the Starks, of course, plus Davos (because he's always around despite being a very minor knight) and Brienne of Tarth (her parents are dead?) and a grown Robin Arryn, plus Edmure Tully and Sam Tarly and various others, including a new Dornish prince whose name is never uttered.
They decide, at Tyrion's urging, that Bran is made king and that from now on kings are chosen by the noble Houses rather than by birth, because kings' sons are monsters more often than not. Everyone agrees, including Bran, and Bran The Broken is named king. ""Why do you think I came all this way?"" Bran (aka the Three-Eyed Raven) says.
Bran names Tyrion Hand, a fitting punishment for all his screw-ups according to the new king. This seems to convince Grey Worm. Grey Worm also agrees to Jon Snow being sent back to the Night's Watch, and for some reason everyone adheres to this plan even though Grey Worm and the invading armies all leave and they could just have Jon come back to Winterfell a few months later.
Sansa is the only one who doesn't bend the knee to her brother. She insists on the North maintaining its independence and Bran agrees (nepotism, that) and Sansa ultimately becomes Queen in the North, which she deserves.
Arya heads out West of Westeros on a crazy exploration adventure. She will eventually find the New World and carry over Westerosi germs that will wipe out half the indigenous population, making her an even more terrible mass murderer than Daenerys.
Actually this really felt like a spinoff moment to me. Arya The Explora, the new show from HBO about a crazy badass female assassin exploring uncharted lands, finding ancient treasures and getting into one wild high jinks after anotherI liked this episode, and at times I thought it was truly brilliant. Drogon emerging from that pile of snow, ruffling ice from his wings, was such a cool moment. The shots of King's Landing in the snow and ash were unbelievably beautiful. There is no other show that is so visually evocative (something only matched by its gorgeous musical score).I'm seriously so happy about the Jon/Ghost reunion and the fact that Jon and Tormund are gonna go make trouble in the True North that I can almost forgive everything else.
Speaking of CGI creatures, Drogon has never been so alive, so emotionally real. Very impressive. This was a hell of a show, people. No matter the flaws in this season and last, no matter the various bad decisions over the years (changing Sansa and Littlefinger's storylines so drastically remains one of the show's gravest sins) it's still one of the best TV shows ever made. x

3246,"No more Iron Throne, no more terrible children born to terrible parents who become terrible rulers. The Six Kingdoms can thrive in the new world that has been built.Once again this episode has a low IMDb rating because many fans want the show to go exactly how they believed or hoped it would. They feel entitled to the show going exactly how they wanted for some reason, and claim it's ""poor writing"" if this doesn't happen.Nothing that has happened in the whole series has been ""pointless"" as some claim. People are missing the point if they believe this. Some character's storylines have gone in different directions than it seemed earlier, that doesn't make their previous storyline pointless, it's about developing their character and them facing choices, and providing the audience with shocks along the way, something that Game of Thrones has made its name for.For example, some people are claiming Jon being resurrected was pointless. He saved the world from its two biggest threats - the Night King and Daenerys. Without him, the dead would never have been defeated, and even if they were, Dany would've ruled with a reign of terror. He is the Prince Who Was Promised. His destiny was not to sit on the Iron Throne, but to ""be the shield that guards the realms of men"". He fulfilled this destiny and will continue to do so, in the North, where he belongs.This was a great way to round off the show. The Game of Thrones writers do not have any duty to fulfil fans' wishes. It ended the way it should, in a ""bittersweet"" way.",10,20 May 2019,10,22

3248,"I am so disappointed with the last season, I cannot even fathom how disappointed I still am. This happens when you don't have books anymore, you can just do whatever you want.
It's not because they had some sort of vague idea of how George R.R. Martin wants the books to end, that they had the right to completely ignore every important detail that needs to wrap up the story. To name a few:
Why did Jon have to be a Targaryen? Was it necessary for the storyline, NO or at least not to the show. He could have remained Jon Snow, team up with Daenerys, see her go mad (because she would have done the same thing even without her knowing he's her long lost nephew), and then kill her (in the lamest way possible).
Next, where was the prince that was promised, the one born out of ice and fire?
It's not Bran, it's not Arya, and apparently it was NOBODY. Not important, let's just forget about it? I THINK NOT! And no dragon has three head explanation either.
Why was the Night King important? Why did he come back now, in this particular time. What was his purpose, besides being a bit of nuisance, but it seemed he was easy to get rid off (just ask Arya). In one episode they beat him? In the previous season they were so hard to beat, and now it was like, let's wrap this up and move on. That's not how you write an ending to a show! The Night King had a connection with Bran, and was created by the children of the forest. But WHY did he come back now? It has everything to do with the prince that was promised, Azor Ahai, which is supposed to be explained in some way. BUT NO. Wrap this up, they won't notice that we have no idea what we're doing.
And then something else that has bothered me since they mentioned him in the show, where was Howland Reed? You did mention him in season 1. But for some reason he didn't show up even when all the people in the North and even Jaimie Lannister came together to fight the dead? Howland Reed could have easily confirmed Jon being Lyanna's son, so we wouldn't have needed Sam and Bran's weird little rushed discovery.
I just cannot be angry any longer. So please George, write you last two books. I really need to know what's going on with Lady Stoneheart, Rickon, the guy in the Citadel who could be Jaqen, young Griff (is he really Aegon the son of Rhaegar?), Arya's training, ... Don't let us wait any longer, we deserve to know the real ending.",1,25 May 2019,7,14
3249,"I remember when I cared about this show. Every time I started to watch an episode I was anxious to know the fate of the characters I loved. GoT's high points brought us some of the best moments in the history of television, I don't think anyone can deny that, but after this episode finished, I wasn't mad, sad, or frustrated like I felt after episodes 3,4 and 5.

There were a few sweet moments (Brienne) but I feel like I was looking forward to a marathon viewing from the start, and now I don't want to reach the ending again. Shame. Shame. Shame :( After delaying the season by a year, I would have expected a bit more of a quality/fans sense check for the ending.The cast are brilliant though.

Character archs go backwards, characters make decisions that don't make sense for them, and it stops feeling like the show we once knew.The main plot points within the season have been fine, but they fail to explain what leads characters down certain paths, and fail to explain what is motivating them to make these choices. Major plot lines result in nothing, and make no difference in the end. If something is focused on extremely heavily, but ultimately doesn't have an impact on the story, it should not be written in.In conclusion, the story comes to a dull end, and is rushed to conclude in a blurry and unsatisfying way. This season is scratched together to force an ending, and in doing so it loses the charm it once had.",1,20 May 2019,7,14

Dany's death by the only guy he loved after they made her mad. Terrible.
Bran is even not participating in one whole season. His path was most boring of all. Hia role was nothing important. The only thing he did is to call Dany and Jon relatives. Everything else is stupid. Sansa is again all alone. She got what she wanted, but again lost her family. I know they were not family for years, but, c'mon. Arya going to West?

I am really surprised on how is it even possible to destroy in such a weird way one of the best films/series ever made.
To be honest, I dont know if this has to do with the fact that El Chapo fell to prison before the work for this started and the cocaine quality perhaps or the weed coming from Mexico that D&D might have been using has had a decline in terms of quality and perhaps it gave them side effects on their minds and vision.

The thing is very clear that D&D cannot be compared to GRRM. They doesn't have the writing skill nor the imagination compared to GRRM. They did have the source materials to work with up until season 4/5, and you can see the show clearly shines during that time.
Season 8 was a big dissapointment and it really should have been 10 seasons long.
GRRM gave some tips to D&D on how end the show should go like and the real plot twist I'm thinking here is that, since the new book of GRRM is coming out and why would people want to buy the books if they already know the ending to it....so he came up with the most lousy way to end the finale and made the infamous season 8 crediting D&D.

But imdb is not showing my comment in the review section at the moment . I predicted this long time ago though. Only one Targaryen will live. I was so so right about this. However, I can feel what others are feeling about how it ends. It needs better scripts. They should have added more episodes about her evilness.
The moment they showed John is another Targaryen, u should have guessed it was either they rule or one rules. And I even guessed about John or one and only Leinster will kill the queen. Guess what , straight as an arrow. But my guessing and desire are just totally different. I was hoping they both rule together.And Most of the low ratings seems to come from people who don't like how they treated Emily's powerful reputations and the scripts.If people can really realise on how characters develops, why all main characters are dying and what the story is about since the beginning, the ending won't be bitter and mysterious to you. Yet this defies everything about GOT shows that the truth is bitter in everyway and even if u know what will happen, u wouldn't dare to think about it.",10,22 May 2019,5,9
3277,"Alright, I'll keep this simple. There's so much wrong this season that's it's not even worth it getting into the specifics.
This season had enough material to cover AT LEAST two more seasons; instead they decided to cram it all into six episodes, which amount to barely seven hours of screentime. That's not nearly enough and it shows. Everything is rushed and as a result characters and their arcs are completely ruined. Under difference circumstances, the events of this season, if developed properly, would've made for two great final seasons. The problem is not what happens; the problem is how. I've been saying this since season 7.
Great job, Benioff and Weiss. I truly hope you won't disappoint Star Wars as much as you did with us. They really don't deserve that.

I am ok with not getting the end I want but I wanted to see Arya change her face one last time, Night's king plot not like zombie b-movie and of course to be the final villain or the final good character trying to save Westeros from all of these madness, Jon killing Danny to craft light bringer in the ruins of throne room (for Danny's vision to make sense), unexpected plot twist on combats with direwolves and Melissandre's army, Bran's abilities expanding and giving advantages, Jon's heritage to be meaningful. Something about all of this 7 years build up to makes sense something monumental something big.
Moreover, how the Dothraki and the Unsullied multiply in numbers in each episode? What is the reason for night's watch existence? Cersei and Jamie could walk 2 meters away and live? How Danny destroyed all ships and ballistras and in a previous episode just flew away?

3285,"I'll explain it to you, because your review is getting the most votes. You said:""Jon's heritage being seemingly not important, the woeful execution of Danny going mad, Bran being king even though he didn't do anything at all, Drogon flying off into the 'sunset', Rhaegal being killed, missing the reaction of Sansa and Arya's when Jon revealed his real parents and most of all for me, no one sticking up for Jon in the meeting with all the powerful lords... He literally killed the woman he loved and saved countless lives in the process and he gets nothing in return, its shameful.""How can a self-professed GoT superfan so SPECTACULARLY missed the entire point?
HERE is why Jon's parentage mattered: it presented a challenge to Daenerys' claim. It wasn't about Jon sitting on the throne. It was about preventing a ""benevolent dictator"" from sitting on it. ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely."" Bran knew that, and it's why he made sure Jon knew who he really was. NOT because heritage matters. The show taught us from SEASON ONE that it does not. No, he was told who he was so that there would be an ace in the hole to undermine Daenerys. Let me explain this to you.Every dictator is convinced that their vision is the only correct one. Daenerys was showing this trait LONG before she decided killing the innocent was an acceptable sacrifice for enacting her utopia. For example, when she countered Selmy's request for mercy by stating ""I will repay injustice with justice."" And who decides what is justice? Daenerys, and Daenerys alone. Are you starting to see the problem?That is what Bran realized, and it's why he facilitated Jon finding out his parentage. It is the ONLY reason it matters in the show: because all dictators, even ""good"" ones, will eventually do acts that hurt the people.That is also why Bran becomes king. He is the only person who isn't really human, and every human dictator will eventually be corrupted by power. Bran won't because he has no desires. His successors will, but their rule will be tempered by the fact that their only ""divine right to rule"" will be because the representatives of the people select them. There will be no more ""it's my destiny to rule"" ideology. Instead it will be, ""I convinced other people I am the best suited for it,"" which will make them all politicians and not dictators with a god complex.
That was the point. The Iron Throne was meaningless. That was shown in Daenerys' vision in Season 2. It was shown in the finale. No one should sit on the throne, and rulers should be CHOSEN.
I suggest you restart the show and this time be receptive to the lesson being beat over your head from the very first episode.
Final note: The complaints about the plot being rushed are valid. But any complaints about where the show ended are being made by people who completely missed the point. Including you.",10,20 May 2019,5,9

3288,"I have been watching GoT and reading George's wonderful books since 2012. I fell in love with the rich history, the characters, the world, and the stories. Ever since season 5 began, this show has rapidly gone downhill. Shock value took precedence over good storytelling, characters acted out of character, people could teleport, plots became boring or nonsensical, and past events and prophecies became useless or pointless. Now that we have reached the end, I am disappointed. This was my favorite show for years, but ever since the disastrous season 5, I have lost my faith a little more with each episode that aired. Now the end has come, and all of the beauty of the earlier seasons has gone out the window. The music and acting and cinematography - all lovely, as always. But the writing? The sudden descent of Daenerys into madness? The mad queen arc has been foreshadowed, yes, but it should have been done over a couple seasons, not a couple MINUTES. It feels like there was no point to Jon's resurrection or parentage, no consistency, no heart in this season. I am a diehard Sansa fan through and through, and I am happy she is queen in the north now, but that doesn't make up for everything. Poor Daenerys. So much character assassination.

What was the point in even bringing him back and learning about his heritage?! In the end it didn't even matter that he was half Targaryen. And how did Grey Worm even get to decide what happens to Jon, how did he get to express his opinions to the council of nobles? He's a nobody, just a soldier without his Queen, with no title, no land..... Not even the so-called ruler of the Seven Kingdoms (Bran) could be bothered to tell him to shut the hell up. And how does the dragon even realise that the Iron Throne is symbolically important and was the thing that his Mama wanted?

Dear viewers and 1-star-critics: NEVER forget that Denarys since Season 2 countless times a) called herself the only chosen one for the Iron Throne and b) threatens persons, citys and lands to kill and obliterate everything and anybody who stands in her way c) kills people (by fire)! I know, her move to the dark place of feeling abandoned by her allies/friends was way too rushed in ep. 4 and 5, but the direction of her character development was clear since the birth of her dragons at the end of season 1 - and converges with George R.

This by no means is a terrible ending, bran being the king is a logical solution, the phrase ""those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it"" he is all knowing and will be able to make the fairest judgement in situations furthermore this democracy they are starting is the fairness that daenerys and varys always wanted even though they were not the ones that made the change in the end. Sansa the queen of the north is what the north have been fighting for in the beginning and theyve finally achieved it, jon beyond the wall (although not were everyone wanted him to end up) is the best place for his character arc. He never wanted to be king, he was great at uniting people and fighting in a time of war but the world is now at peace and i dont feel he would be great as king or fit his character. Daenerys becoming mad has been hinted from the very beginning it was always going to happen, and the last episode tied in why she did it nicely, if it wasnt for her this new era would have not been able to be introduced.
However i do believe the season has been dissapointing overall and has by far been one of the worst. Shoddy dialogue, not staying true to characters, situations making little sense except as plot devices even the CGI in the last episode was the worst its been. The ending was good but how they got there wasnt satisfying. People will hate on the ending purely for this reason and because what they wanted to happen didnt. this episode also had plot holes; grey worm loved the queen, it doesnt make sense for him to not kill jon on the spot, furthermore at tyrions trial hardly any of the characters personalities shone through the scene . So many deaths were shot poorly; daenerys, cersei and even the build up to varys was a bit crap, i feel they have forgotten how the composing can really add to the feeling in the episode.

3365,"Before season 8 had started, I went back and watched GoT all the way from S1E1 to S7E7 within a month. The character development, the plot, the acting... It was an incredible work of art! There was no other show like it within that genre. And then season 8 started...At first I was hopeful. Knowing this season would only have 6 episodes, I expected a jaw-dropping performance to end this masterpiece with the viewers in disbelief; an unpredictable ending that could close all loose ends without destroying what they had built up in these last 8 years. But by the end of episode 3, I grew more skeptical. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed The Long Night, but I could see why everyone was frustrated. Even so, I defended the writers... By the end of episode 4, I started to lose hope.By the end of this finale I didn't even feel like I was watching GoT anymore. The style is so far off from what we've all come to love over the last several years, I could have mistaken it to be directed by a 3rd grade student. I was intently watching the screen when Daenerys and Jon were having their moment, my phone went off, I looked down, back up, annnnd Daenerys is dead... Within a blink of an eye...During the entire series Daenerys is hellbent on standing up for those who can't stand up for themselves, then she snaps after Cersei has Missandei killed right in front of her, I get it. It's weak writing, but I get it. What bothers me is that she didn't feel any remorse after it was all said and done. I'm sure they did that to sell the idea of Jon killing Daenerys, but a Romeo and Juliet-style ending would have made more sense at this point. Daenerys coming to her senses after completely massacring an entire city, and begging Jon to end her life would have been more pleasing than this.The last few minutes of the episode only added more insult to injury. Sansa becomes the Queen of the North. Arya sets sail for the west. John gets sent back to the Wall. And finally, Bran (who couldn't become the King of the North because he's the three eyed raven) becomes the King of the 6 kingdoms (you know, because everyone agreed to let the north be it's own independent kingdom as if it was no big deal whatsoever) like it was meant to be. Happy endings all around! I didn't realize we were watching Friends. If the writers needed help deciding on how they should end the series, they could have went to Reddit... But this was just pathetic.And for everyone saying that people just can't come to terms with the fact that the show had to come to an end at some point, I wholeheartedly disagree. Look at Breaking Bad's finale. Vince Gilligan ended Breaking Bad perfectly! Though Walter White was probably one of the most loved characters in the series, it couldn't have ended without him dying. No other ending would have given the show justice. I guess we can throw this series in with Dexter.Pity.",1,20 May 2019,5,9

""Ignore the trolls!""?Well, rather than calling people names or ""not getting it"", perhaps it's time to get an IQ and see what is absolutely obvious:Half of season 6 - and all of season 7 and 8 - have been shockingly bad. The writing has fallen off a cliff because they didn't have GRRM's novels to extend this to another 5 seasons of glorious writing that made sense.We got, instead, a mad queen out of thin air - and a stupid, contrived ending to go with it. I mean, honestly, BRAN as the king! I don't know whether to laugh or weep. None of this makes any sense and even more annoying is the fact Sansa ended up ruling the North.Jon Snow's arc thrown away. Why bother bringing him back to life if the prophecy and all the lead up was going to abandoned?
Dany's arc destroyed in the most monstrous way imaginable.
Bran didn't even get a proper arc - he just looked cryptic all the time for no reason.
Jaime's arc thrown away.
Arya's arc went nowhere and Bravos was a load of tosh.
We still don't even know what Varys heard in the flames. Who cares, right?
Sansa's entire story line after season 4 was horse manure and this episode just puts the final steam on the turd.Also, I can't stand Sophie Turner - she's playing herself - Rich and in love with herself. She's no longer portraying her character.And just when you felt it couldn't get any sillier, Sam does a Lord of the Rings by creating the book A Song of Ice and Fire.GRRM deserved better than the garbage D&D have churned out.

3397,"People are overreacting a lot in this season. Imdb is also full of 1 star ratings out of agitated fans. Whatever it is, the episodes deserve more than 1 star for cinematography, acting, sound, editing, direction etc. 1 star? They want answers to everything just in this season (season 4 had a goof up with Jaimie holding soda as well but no one noticed then). I personally liked this season as well. Bran is perfect for the throne, being a King is the best use of his Warg abilities. Plus no obligations to crown the progeny if they turn out to be bad like Joffrey. This will bring democracy in the Westeros. Tyrion will be happy being Bran's hand. His thoughts always used to be noble since the beginning no matter what. He will be happy for once. Jon will be free forever with his brother Tommund now. Arya will lead exploration to the west of the Westeros. Sansa deserved it. Being a Queen needs wisdom and she experienced enough with Joffrey, Littlefinger, Ramsay, in the King's landing, during the battle of Bastards to get some of it. She'll be a wise queen in the north. Dany killed children, and moms and dads. Children saw their mothers being burnt in front of them. She needed to go. Jaimie will no longer be a King's slayer. His stories have been engraved. Ghost finally got some love! Sam got a perfect position for him. Bronn and Tyrion will continue their stories in the peaceful Westeros. Podrick is a knight! Everything is perfect. And still people want different endings? You can NEVER satisfy everyone. Although I believe the writing was a bit rushed and the impact could've been better but there were good moments in every single episode and those getting belligerent at every single thing they're trying to show on-screen in this season, rating 1 stars and blaming the conclusion are sniveling souls satisfying themselves out of the egos they're getting from their ""opinions"". Suddenly everyone has become wise enough to judge writing now. Every single person has their imagination of who deserved what in the show. And how's it going to happen exactly? Most are on the train because criticizing and over-analyzing all the GOT episodes is the ""cool trend"" going on right now.. I personally, liked the conclusions that happened in this universe.

Religion. Countless topics you can discuss with others for hours on end. This is Game of Thrones. It's messy and unpredictable and it's what we all loved about it.

Most can't put their finger on exactly what drew them in to the series but it's obvious to anyone who was already critical of the bland story-by-committee formulaic television that's been spoon fed to us decade after decade.

Tirion couldn't speak a single word, but he made a 5 minute long speach which lead to Brandon's king nomination. The unsully had no mercy for the lannisters, but for Jon Snow they kept him prisoner. Why? To not start a war? Please... Jamie and Lanister couldn't get away, but Tirion manage to get to him. Oh, what a brilliant death they got. A great villein getting killed by bricks. All this season was an epic fail. What a terrible way to finish one of the greatest shows I've ever seen! And it hurts my heart knowing that Dumb&Dumber will be writers and producers for the next Star Wars Triology, a saga that is already screwed is about to get so much worse!!!",1,21 May 2019,6,12

3439,"None of these negative reviews are taking anything realistic into consideration. How do you create an ""end"" to something that can literally go on for an infinite amount of years? it was an impossible task to provide perfect endings for every single character or storyline. and they did as good of a job as anyone could. Thanks for a great 8 years.
as for this episode - it provided just enough answers to the questions that needed to be addressed. but still leaves a million questions, as any good story does. again, think of it as more of a ""story"" being told than a ""box office avengers"" type weird thing.Jon killed the Queen and Grey Worm took him and held him for it. grey worm is loyal to his queen and wanted revenge. duh.Jons heritage does matter because Drogon did not kill him, instead, Dorgon burned the throne. it matters for that purpose. it matters because it is one of the many things that caused khaleesi to go nuts (cashews) --- but it does not matter to jon, hence, why he is heading north beyond that wall, where he belongs. it is not important anymore, but it was important for how certain things played out. (sansa telling tyrion. etc)Bran did everything. simple as that. he says ""you were exactly where you needed to be."" to multiple characters. this is the game of chess he has been playing all along. people saying ""bran did nothing"" are so repulsively wrong. think about it. he was playing chess ever since he became the one eyed one horned flying purple people eater. (three eyed raven)Rhaegal was killed because it was showing how dany was underestimating the next enemy after the dead, the living. she learns from it, adapts, and is why she was able to destroy kings landing. (dragons should come from high above, not soar at eye level for ships to see)the reaction of sansa and arya finding out the truth about who jon is, is unimportant because we know how they would react, why do you need to see it? weirdos. all that matters from that is what happens next, and that is shown. sansa runs to tyrion and sets the mad queen plan in motion. (sansa knew dany was going to destroy err thang in the club, never trusted her, she was trying to set it all in motion, like little finger would have)all the lords had jons back at the end of the day. they just wanted to hear tyrion out. that was all.Jon got everything he needed in return. if you actually watched the show start to finish, you would know that jon was happiest when with the wildlings. that's where he REALLY fell in love. that's where he is heading. that's where he belongs.negative reviewers - please reread all of your reviews, I have read hundreds. I respect the opinions but it is all based on nonsense. you can knit pick any show in the world. knit pick it with a positive spin instead of negative.the finale brought the show in full circle. all the dialogue, character development, story lines, everything played a role. it was a beautifully told story. the hero you loved all along, died deservingly. (your ""mad queen who burnt thousands of children after the battle was won"") thank you jon snow for choosing duty over love.",10,20 May 2019,6,12

The only thing of value he did was that he revealed Jon's real identity .. apart from that - useless#3 so Jon the rightful heir to the throne, kills someone who had a lesser claim to the throne, killed a tyrant who was mad with power and destroyed countless of innocent lives and was about to do more damage.... and he gets the night's watch for it???!!! He should be rewarded for it not punished? It just makes no sense to me at all. He was the best leader, they defeated the NK because of him (because no one believed there was any threat), he always did the right thing. I expected it to be bitter sweet but I figured it would be either Jon lives and rules and everyone else dies or Jon dies in some heroic way saving the world.#4 Jon's identity was actually a useless piece of information because it didn't change anything. It was built up so much only to mean nothing in the end.#5 why does the night's watch even exist? No NK and they're at peace with wildlings .. so what's the point?#6 the ONLY thing I was happy about was Jon's reunion with ghost ... that's it.#7 I was glad Jon killed Dany but I didn't like how it was done.

3456,"The episode is titled The Iron Throne. The Iron Throne was the wheel (metaphorically) that Daenerys wanted to break. But eventually it was the wheel that broke her (the corruption of power). Thus, Daenerys' death put an end to the game of thrones. There would no longer be the need of a game of thrones in Westeros between its noble houses. Power would no longer be hereditary nor determined by blood nor something someone would start wars for. Power would no longer mean tyranny nor dictatorship. Power would be determined in a democratic way, being Bran The Broken the first democratically elected king in Westeros. That was what Daenerys, by dying, accomplished. She did break the wheel after all. That would forever be her legacy. Jon Snow didn't fit in any of this. The wheel would have never been broken as long as there was a Targaryen ruling as a king. Jon went north of the Wall with the people who taught him what it really means to be free. I can't see a more suitable ending for him. Jon Snow did know something after all. That is who he always was, since the very first episode of the very first season. Just like Arya. Forever a wanderer. Forever a free spirit. Forever an inspiration. Sansa played the game of thrones and she won. It was either winning or dying. She learnt from the best players after all. Sansa, Bran, Arya, Jon. The last four of the Starks fulfilled their personal and internal prophecies and became who they always were supposed to be, albeit apart from each other. No longer together, just as they were, in Winterfell, in one of the first scene of the first episode of Game of Thrones (if someone ever doubts the show was about the Starks, that scene should clear all doubts).Art is not consensual and it should never be. Apparently many people like the way the show ended, which proves that the writers aren't all tat incompetent and that it is not ""the worst"" finale ever (unless the people who claim so are actually assuming their IQ and good taste in TV shows are superior and better than those of the ones who happen to like the direction that was taken). Art occurs when the subjective vision of an artist manages to reach and communicate with at least another subjective heart and mind. If Game of Thrones wanted to be consensual, it would be that average TV show everybody forgets about two years after it ends. If it wanted to be consensual, it would have been considered a watchable TV show by 99 % of its viewers. But it would have never been considered art by a fraction of its audience.

3478,"Yes, this season's writing has been a step down from what this show once was. Yes, the past two seasons were rushed. Yes, D&D made a huge mistake in rushing it. Yes, there have been some inexcusable mistakes this season. All that being said, this was a very solid episode with incredible visuals, acting, and music, and some beautiful dialogue.I do think the second half felt a little cheesy, but I think the ending overall is great and I'm sure this will be George's ending as well. I hope so because it's a beautiful way to end it all.With regard to all of the viscous hatred coming from the 1 star reviews, all I can say is that it makes me sad. The fact that people are raging about a TV show as if someone just murdered their loved one is actually pretty remarkable. It just goes to show what an incredible show Game of Thrones was that it inspired such passion. Maybe once these people calm down, take a deep breath, get some fresh air, and get some sleep, they'll recover from their anger.In reality, I think this episode deserves an 8/10, and the season as a whole deserves as 7/10. Unfortunately, it's difficult to give a reasonable rating when 90% of the reviews are from people who were probably so blinded by rage for the past three weeks that they didn't even actually watch the episode.Very few TV shows end on a high note. Sadly, Game of Thrones was not one of them.

3494,"When Tyrion stands trial for his actions committed in the previous episode, he asks Jon, the one character who had actually witnessed the mystery that is death, if there is life after it. To which Jon replies, ""not that I've seen.""This is the fundamental difference between the works of GRRM and the likes of Tolkien, Martin's greatest influence and true predecessor as a writer/storyteller. Whereas one seemingly has a more chaotic outlook of life's greater purpose, the other's theistic worldview gave each of his stories credence in contributing to the bigger picture of the world he had created. And, if it's true that Martin gave the showrunners a general ""outline"" of how his story would end, this seems to be the case with what we received in the series finale, and the season as a whole.After thousands of years of dormancy, the White Walkers have returned...for nothing. After uniting the free folk with the North in an effort to save humanity, Jon Snow dies...and is resurrected!...for nothing. Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark gave birth to this savior, making him the true heir to the Iron Throne, a joining of two of the greatest houses in the realm...for nothing-when in the last episode this was a ""secret"" that became ""information"" which led to...you guessed it! Absolutely nothing. Dany's whole journey to achieve the throne that was taken from her family...for nothing, only to go ""mad,"" become a heartless dictator, never sit on the throne, and have her child burn it into molten iron.Bran became the Three Eyed Raven...I would say for nothing, but he became king, so I guess that's something? The implications alone could yield interesting discussion. Maybe it could have been written as the Children of the Forest reclaiming the lands that were stolen from them after thousands of years of turmoil from the oppression of Men. The Night King could have been wanting to kill the 3ER to save humanity from Bran's nefarious plot to rule the world, since the NK probably hates the Children for creating him, as evidenced by his slaughter of them in season 6. Or, maybe the NK was reaching for his sword to pledge his allegiance to Bran, since Bran was the ultimate puppet master in the end who would have ended humanity and the game of thrones once and for all to build a new world from scratch. The NK may have just wanted to protect the survival of his race. I mean, give us *something*, show!Wouldn't it have been cool if any of this lore was explored or hinted at even in the slightest? But nah, Bran gets the throne, all while sitting there and doing...nothing. I could go on, but I feel there is nothing else to say. It's over.Does one need a theistic worldview in order to make a good story? Or a story that at least has a satisfying conclusion? Absolutely not. But a search and desire for meaning is a basic human trait I think most of us share. We want to know why we're part of our stories. And what makes us all unique is how we go about assigning that meaning, no matter what one chooses, to our everyday experiences.Without that, the events of the series become just another story in a long line of stories, as Maester Sam shows us at the end of the episode with his book. At its core, GoT had a world with a rich history of legends and tales that have all led up to this particular moment in time. And what was the purpose? Why did we witness the aftermath of Robert's Rebellion specifically; why was this the subject that needed attention in the greater history of Westeros? I don't know.
Bran became king because he can tell the best stories of them all...yet the reasoning behind it all felt like a vapid coldness of character assassination and anti-climax. The most interesting characters (Jon, Jaime, Tyrion, Dany) revert back right where they started or become victims to the plot, the least interesting characters (Arya, Bran, Sansa) get to do all the cool stuff, and the viewers who once loved this will go back and watch it, knowing how it ends, and they will constantly be reminded of GoT's tarnished legacy.Perhaps this was the intention-the game of thrones is but an exercise in futility, as is life in the grand scheme of things. And if that was the case, then this story wasn't made for me. But, with all this buildup, with years of world-building and sharp characterization, the final, meaningless crescendo falls flat. The Song of Ice and Fire is muted, and a vast, empty silence ensues.",2,20 May 2019,4,7

He is no longer Bran, Bran died back in the cave and now he is the 3 Eyed Raven, he can't be lord of anything, in his own words. He is not supposed to be anything but the 3 Eyed Raven. Ok, and there are the prophesies that kept being mentioned throughout the show, what happened to them? Too many questions, too many gaps in the story, a lot of nonsense, and finally all rushed to the end. The spent years telling a great story, how they went from A to B, and so on, to just jump without any reasoning behind them, to the end.

This season 8 ep 5 & 6 just screwed all the tv series season. No point of having John Snow until the end. If he's dead thats ok. Just sent him again to nights watch. Grey Worm, Dothraki Army what will happen to them if there's queen is dead. This is like a school drama. Waste of time. This will impact highly to every future TV series in HBO.

Right now I wish half of them died because Theon (who was high on my list) had better story this season than ser Davos or Brienne for instance. I'm not even going to talk about Jon.

3) Tyrion and Jon are set free from Grey Worm, again like no one cares anymore for the fact that the queen was betrayed and murdered.
3) basically nothing changed from the begininng of the series, except for the fact that now bran is on the throne, and he seems to have known that from quite some time.
4) Arya starts to travel from West, like Colombo, because the writers had no idea of what to do with her characters.

I hope the actors and actresses are not given hate, they did a fine job. The writers and producers pulled the wool over the viewer's eyes with the promise of finality of epic proportions. 2 shorter seasons for what?

The ending doesn't really bother me, it's the way got there. The thing many fans loved about Game of Thrones was it's mastery of storytelling. Sure the effects were awesome and the sets, costumes, and camera work were incredible but the way it was written and then preformed is what made it so alluring. There aren't many shows/movies that offer a genuine escape from reality, but GoT did and that was completely absent for most of seasons 7 and 8. It happened so fast in order to get the storyline worked into the time they had left that we didn't have time to enjoy the story. If you take major events, and character development, it took from seasons 1-4 to tell as much of the story as a single episode of seasons 7-8. The story was the show's magic, and in this season that magic was lost. The actors were phenomenal, as always, the sets amazing, the cgi work and editing too, but I felt like all of that was wasted on a story that has simply been rushed to the point of losing its integrity.

How was Tyrion, as a prisioner, able to negotiate with the most important lords of Westeros, and named Hand of the Queen at the same time, and Grey Worm just stood there like an idiot. And then when he was named Hand of the King, Grey Worm suddenly said ""no"".3. Also, very mad about Jon Snow's ending. No offense to Bran, how can they give the throne to freaking Bran. Is he even fully human? Bran's character is supposed to be a sidekick, we have no emotional attachment to him whatsoever as he's not one of the main characters. Naming him the king is just as important as naming someone Gendry the king.4. Also, why is Arya always sailing somewhere? They're clearly trying to copy off Season 4 ending where Arya's sailing except this ending doesn't make any sense at all.Poor writing, poor directing. Complete waste of the actors' talents and great music score. No wonder the actors hate this season so much. Feels like they aren't even trying and just wanna end it.

3596,I still can't believe why they would ruin this amazing show? The ending is horrible. So many huge storyline from the previous seasons got thrown under the bus. I was so excited to watch it but the last 2 episodes where just horrible. They destroyed everything.,1,20 May 2019,4,7

3600,"Many things didn't make any sense at all. Season 8 didn't feel like the natural Game of Thrones, it feels rushed, it feels like another Hollywood cheesy movie. Jon Snow started at the Nights Watch to end up back at it?Next, Bran knew all along that he was going to be king, that's why he said ""That's why I came all this way."" I find this very greedy of Bran. He even said he didn't even ""want"" anymore. Him being the three eyed raven was useless, even though he discovered Jon Snow was a Targaryen, that side of the story proved to be useless as well. The ending was poorly created and written, it didn't have to have a happy ending but rather a ending that was explain and reasonable, the show ended with many unknown answers which is wild.Cersei was another main character in the show for 8 seasons whose death happened by cement falling on her and Jaime. That was a fail as well. Seasons 1-7, were unbelievable, season 8 made me cringe.",5,20 May 2019,4,7
3601,"This ending was okay in terms of what it ultimately decided would be the fate of each character. The issue is it attempts to make everything wrap up in a neat bow...but that doesn't suit this story that tries to break away from those cliches.The ending is at once much too happy, and too cliche to fit with why this show became so big in the first place. They rushed things to the point of having to have someone just explain to the audience why a character effectively did a heel turn and why they had to suddenly die.While I can respect that, as GoT tries to be more realistic than typical fantasy, it also tends to do that by focusing on the details and telling the story. This episode, and the season really, rush past all the details and satisfaction that would come from telling that story. We lose so many moments and explanations.This episode reminds me of being a kid. When I was loving a story I was being told...and then it was cut short, rushed, and even given a lousy ending just to get me to go to sleep.I truly believe that the writers were just rushing to get to their next project, and it shows through. It truly is a shame.That said the actors, cinematography, and effects are so good that they each give this a whole start. The writing is so bad that I can't justify going past that.",3,20 May 2019,4,7

3604,"Game of Thrones drew us in from the very beginning because of its savagery, and painful tactics. It was both statistic and cruel which left the audience desiring a taste for ""good to conquer evil."" Evil seemed to prevail at every turn. But, we sought this good in numerous characters that we fell in love with for 7 seasons, just to be let down by a melodramatic ending. Boring and completely mortified. What happy ending were we promised? Not that a happy was a necessity. It hadn't been for 7 seasons and we were still thirsty for more. In conclusion, absolutely any alternative ending would have sufficed.

The choice of Bran is a logical one for Westeros because he has no allegiances or loyalties to anyone. But for a high caliber tv show it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.Its another instance of a great show with a terrible ending. Seasons 1-4 were a 9.5/10. Seasons 5-6 and 8.5/10. Concluding with season 7 and 8 at a 6/10. I give it a 6 because of its entertainment and visuals but the story telling was no where near the bar that Thrones set.And now our watch is ended.",1,20 May 2019,4,7

And although there were a couple of laughs and cool shots like Drogon rising from the snow. overall I am immensely disappointed.

Would be a 1/10 based on lost opportunities set up by passed episodes but Jon petting ghost bumps it up an extra star.",1,20 May 2019,4,7

3629,"This show went from hero to zero. The most anticlimactic ending ever. They butchered this amazing show in the finale. GOT created a deep craving that has been left woefully unsatisfied. The finale was so poorly written that most of the main characters lost their authenticity. The episode was like a bad B movie. And the fact that they crowned Bran, the guy who has been wrongly reduced to little more than a prop for this entire season, (despite great expectations to the contrary) is laughable and downright ridiculous. That's the worst part for me. I really felt angered. And who in the world came up with the silly idea of calling him ""Bran the Broken?!"" At least have the good sense to call him ""Bran the Three-Eyed Raven"" if you're gonna make him king. SMH....The young man may be broken in body, but not in mind and spirit! Regardless, Bran should have never been made king. John Snow should have been crowned king! That would have helped to create a satisfying ending, predictable or not. He earned it, and most importantly, he deserved it! You can't butcher an ending in the name of unpredictability.",1,21 May 2019,7,15

3635,"This is the first time I put up a review, I was a huge fan from day one. Very bad writing, could be better if they just waited for the books. Ruining the franchise of Got, only with 3 episodes. Rating 2 only for the Danerys & Drogon scene...",2,20 May 2019,7,15
3636,"Sansa did not deserve to be queen. Her gender made the writers wrote that in. Wasn't really the nepotism by her Crippled Brother, Raisin Bran. Lol. Yes! Him becoming king and granting her the wish to be the ONLY OTHER RULER WAS nepotism, but I blame the writers. They figured the female viewers would protest if a female ruler didn't happen, so they forced it in that Sansa be queen of the north. DUMB! Only a few reviews even mentioned how dumb that was. You can't Complain about the episode being garbage if you don't include Sansa being crowned. I see some clowns writing that they Hated everything about the ending, except Sansa being queen. Nope! You can't have it both ways. Can't cry about the bad, lazy writing, forced destinies of characters and say you like one. All were bad. Actually! Raisin Bran has the PERFECT temperament to be A Leader! Aside from the crippled nature, he is a great leader. Not greedy, not corrupt, has the ability to see EVERYTHING! You don't need to agree that it makes sense, but if anybody deserves the throne, it's him. Different than all the other rulers. Before Dragon mom got stabbed, I knew her being unguarded was a problem. When they started kissing I was asking myself ""where would I stab her. I'd stab her in the back or the neck."" So, I predicted she'd get stabbed, but was slightly off on where. Everything else has been debunked or Debated about. Raisin Bran has the best temper to be leader. Nobody else does. Do I agree with the writing? I'm not sure. Is this the end of the world? Nope! There are children with Cancer! Homeless people that barely eat! This is a show! Life isn't fair. Be grateful that you can cry about garbage writing instead of dying from disease or struggling to find food or shelter. Those are real problems. I haven't watched all the episodes of the series. I REALLY want to watch all Charlotte Hope Episodes. I like Her. I also am Happy I saw Lena Headey's flawless body.Lastly, In 2012, I was at Whole Foods Monsanto in Los Angeles and Right in front of me, 6 inches, Mother Of Dragons was standing, and crouching looking at some bread. And then getting some juice. She had her natural Dark hair, so I didn't recognize her until she was gone. I could've gotten a selfie! What's even sadder, if I were a better actor, I could've been on this show! Sad! Now THAT'S a thing to cry about. Furthermore, I can't watch anything with Sophie Turner in it. That means no X-MEN for me. I gave 3 stars in memory of the Series! Lol. The Episode was so flawed. I was shocked that it was lower than a 7, actually. But I guess many saw the flaws in it.",3,20 May 2019,7,15

Arya going west like she's always wanted ✅
Tyrion becomes hand again✅
Jon Killing Danny ✅
Grey worm and the unsalied going to Narth ✅
Jon going back north where he belongs and can finally rest ✅
The throne melting ✅
Brianne writing down all of Jamie's good deeds ✅
Okay Bran getting the throne was questionable but I can get behind this New Democratic approach to succession ✅I feel like it wrapped everything up very nicely and I hope the fans can try to accept that books and the show are two different things and that they will get George's ending eventually but for now this was beautiful.",10,20 May 2019,57,184

Fan theories ruin the surprise and create conflict between the reality of what's on the screen and their own imagination. First of all, it's not cool to spoil the ending, second of all, is not cool to hate something just because you don't like it. I do appreciate the effort to write and produce an amazing show that lasted all these years and kept us on the edge of our seats so a big thank you to the cast, the crew, the cratives and everyone who was involved into making this amazing show. And now my watch is over.",10,20 May 2019,101,345
3643,"It's like everyone here giving it bad reviews hasn't watched the show. Yes, season 8 was... problematic. Everyone writing reviews here wanted a better season and aren't going to get it, but they're not looking at this episode for what it was. The ending to all the characters arcs make sense for them and wrap up their stories in a satisfying way. How can you say Arya's ending came out of nowhere? Her entire story was her being a lone wolf, and now she gets to run free. I mean jeez, she even mentioned going west of Westeros back in season six. And Jon's true lineage didn't matter, that was the whole point! He spent his whole life wanting to be something more than Jon Snow, but in the end, even though he was a true born Targaryen, he realized he just wants to be Jon Snow, king-beyond-the-wall. That's where he really thrived, in the real north. I could go on. This episode wasn't perfect, but it was FAR from bad. It was a very good ending, don't listen to people who only wanted the red wedding every episode. ""But muh buh who's gonna die next?"" That's not all this show is. This episode epitomized the show as a whole: it showed what came after the war/big battle, and it showed the horrors that come from the nobles who obsess over the iron throne.",10,20 May 2019,44,138

They just made multiple accounts just to make sure that this Final Episode is seen as a Joke when it definitely isn't.

What I don't understand: why giving episodes 1/10? This make no sense for me. Sorry, but people love or hate things these days. The world is black and white for some people, but it isn't!

But i cant help seeing here all these so called fans who had read the leaks prior to the show airing, went in to watch the show clouded by judgement, therefore not being able to enjoy the season at all, missing the element of surprise and unknown. Of course there are things to be criticized, but this is the end of an area and for someone who claims to have loved the other seasons, to come here and give 1/10 shows how much of a fan you are to begin with. Again, mistakes aside, this show does absolutely not deserve your filthy 1/10, the actors, the crew, all the people who worked for all these years most certainly don't deserve what you are doing. You all hate the decision of Dany burning King's Landing, but there you are burning down all the colosal work of the cast and crew.
To end all this, i really enjoyed every second of the series and i will always come back. Thank you Game of Thrones and here's to the greatest tv show of all time, to all who worked on it and to all the loyal and ""blind"" fans like me.

3657,"After 8 years we come to the end of the most memorable TV shows in history. Along with Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones has changed the TV landscape forever. Within the fandom, like a minor house I must declare the side I'm on. Overall I have found the season not the best but still exceptional. To me it was a 'happy ending'. I never thought GoT would end like this, before season 8 started I thought it would a big twist where the Night King and his army won. Then midway through I thought Daenerys would claim the Iron Throne but as a tyrant, it would not fully conclude and her small council would conspire to kill, like the ending of The Sopranos.The 'happy ending' wasn't clear though. Daenerys I believe did have a happy conclusion. Her destiny was to gain the Iron Throne which she did, she touched it and she met somebody she loved and even cared for. Then the power of the dagger killed her at the exact moment her life long mission was complete. I was almost in tears when Drogon incinerated the Iron Throne, the Throne that cost his mother and all his brothers, which I thought was such a powerful moment. Her ultimate legacy was freeing the slaves and breaking 'the wheel"". She still died a hero.Around season 5/6 with where all the characters were heading a began to not care who would eventually get the Iron Throne and therefore Bran was a big surprise and shock. I was thinking it could have been Gendry as I thought it might have just gone right back to the beginning.My favourite scene had to be the small council; everyone most beloved characters (except ghost) was now on the small council. With all the wars settled, I thought it was good that they had to go with the reality of running a Kingdom, gold for ships or brothels. Only one of my theories came true that Sam would present all the events in a book 'A Song of Ice and Fire' although I thought it would have been 'A Game of Thrones'.The Starks got the ending they deserved, Arya was free to do as wanted, Sansa after her brother and cousin failed previously finally brought independence to the North. Jon who wanted to be in the Nights Watch but never wanted to be King, even the North, got to return to the Nights Watch where he was truly happy with ghost.It will be a long time before we get another TV show like this. Long may Game of Thrones reign.",8,20 May 2019,11,27
3658,"Which is a good compromised I supoose"" Tyrion Lannister. That quote seems to sum up the reaction around the world to this final episode and final season. At this point I'm completely on my own saying I genuinely loved it, it felt completely resolved to me. I will agree that the dialogue wasn't perhaps as poetic as it has been in the past, but it still moved me. If you have read the books and rewatched the seasons as I have I don't see how your can't appreciate how all roads led to this conclusion, it just felt completely right to me. I feel there is a huge herd mentality, easily recognised by the very repetitive reviews. I'll probably take a break for a few months and then I am ready to re watch it all over again. I will miss the excitement and build up to each episode, nothing else of TV compares to it. Thank you Game of Thrones for the many many hours of entertainment.",10,20 May 2019,11,27
3659,"I can't even begin to count how many hours I've spent watching the show, reading articles, looking for interviews and set photos. Game of Thrones has consumed by life for the better part of the last decade, and now it's over. It's all over. And regardless of what the internet thinks, I think this finale was absolutely perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better end to the journeys of all my favorite TV characters in one hour and a half long night of television. In a divisive and cynical time, I love that Game of Thrones' last big ""twist"" was that it ends in a somewhat predictable and hopeful way.Of course, the episode didn't necessarily start that way, as we see the city in pieces following Daenerys' destruction last week. Watching Tyrion stare Dany in the face, call her out on her BS and throw the Hand of the King pin to the side was brilliantly bold and bada**. If they were going to kill Tyrion, that was a pretty awesome way to end his arc. Luckily, we had a scene with Jon & Tyrion that was just what Jon needed to do what had to be done.I think we all figured Dany's days were numbered after last week, we just weren't sure how exactly she would be killed. It was always expected to be Jon, but having him do it right before she was about to sit on the Throne she spent SEASONS trying to reach, was devastatingly tragic, but absolutely fitting. After all that, ultimately no one gets to sit on the Iron Throne. The next sequence, showcasing all of the Lords of Westeros gathered around Tyrion at first is a bit jarring, but you knew there had to be a nice way to wrap everyone's stories up, especially since there was merely 30 minutes to go. It becomes even more jarring when Tyrion pleads for Bran to be the one to take the Throne, but it all starts to click after that. He is the only one that can't possibly fall into the same sort of poison the throne brings upon everyone who desires it. He is the memory of this world.Drogon takes Dany away, Jon takes the black once again, Tyrion is the new Hand of the King, Sam is grand maester, and Davos, Bronn, Brienne all sit on the new small council. I loved watching Brienne finish Jaime's page in the history of the Knights of the Seven Kingdoms book. Seeing the new small council argue over the small things in the world was fittingly bittersweet. Podrick alive and well and wheeling Bran around! Even seeing Grey Worm going to Naath felt right, though if I was a betting man I could have sworn he would have been toast this season.This show started with the Starks, and I'm thrilled that it ended with the montage of the 3 remaining Starks (we don't count Bran anymore) and their new lives. Sansa as the new Queen of the *Independent* North, Arya going West of Westeros like I hoped, and finally Jon going home, going North. And YES he got his pets to Ghost! It's truly only fitting that we see that one green plant North of The Wall, A DREAM OF SPRING. Thank you Game of Thrones, for everything.10/10",10,20 May 2019,84,285
3660,"The ending was perfect, how do you end a show that's run for this long? Like this! It was all mapped out, it had big things and small, so well done.Good news for the 1/10 reviewers, you don't have to watch it again.",10,20 May 2019,23,66
3661,"**SPOILER**
I guess I have a much different opinion about the season finale then most people do.
Don't get me wrong, the 2 episodes before this one were so disappointing that I wasn't even sure if I was going to watch the finale. Bronn not even showing a little bit of kindness towards Tyrion really bothered me, he might have been selfish but he always cared about Tyrion. Cersei dying weak and crying. Jamie getting mortally wounded by a Greyjoy. What was the point in the Brie and Jamie consummation? Why couldn't they have stayed purely plutonic friends? Brie could have still written his legacy for him and it would have had much more of a heartfelt meaning without the ""hump and dump"". Jamie could have still went after Cersei and the fans would have still loved him for it because we have always known his great love for her. Brie and Jamies consummation was just weird and uncomfortable and unnecessary. Ok off of my soap box about the 2 previous episodes. I only stated this to show how very low my expectations were for the finale-
However, I think it was a good and just finale.
The producers did a brilliant job of making the viewers fall in love with Daenerys story, orphaned, abused girl finding her way to power, seemingly for the slaves and the oppressed. However she was always ok with death if it got her what she needed or wanted or if it was ""justice"". She gave approval to the witch to take a life to save Drogo. Remember the witch told her honestly it would cost a life and Daenerys gave the approval. We were blinded by this because we loved the love story of Drogo and Daenerys. Daenerys was ok with burning the witch alive when she didn't deliver what she promised. She was ok with killing the masters at slavers bay by crucifying them, burning people alive, burning the Tarlys alive. The fans let it slide because they were bad people and we loved
Daenerys, we loved her story. Her conscience has always been initiated by the people around her. Jorah Mormont, Sir Barristan and Tyrion always balanced her and spoke reason to her but her first instinct was always ""justice"". The producers wanted us to fall in love with her and see past all of that just like Jorah, Tyrion and Jon loved her and saw past her weaknesses and made excuses for her madness. Much like the men in her life who loved her it was too late before we realized what was in her, that the madness had grown bigger than the voices of reason.
Now to the Starks- I love that Jon got exactly what he wanted, he didn't want to rule, he never did. He loved the Wildlings. He came to know them, love them, respect them, built relationships with them, he saved them. Jon ruling the Wildlings is a great ending.
STARKS JUSTICE- Sansa ends up ruler of the North, Jon the leader of the wildlings, Bran of the 6 kingdoms and I think we will see a spin off of Arya and what she discovers and ultimately rules over, west of Westeros. Throughout the entire series the Starks never sought the throne or leadership but was thrust into it because they genuinely cared about people. They paid the highest prices, Ned's Father and Brother burned alive, Ned Beheaded, Catlyn and Rob butchered, Rickon murdered, Arya orphaned, Sansas mental and physical torture was horrible, and of course Jon actually being murdered by his own men for saving the wildlings. I like that the Starks are in leadership and democracy is being implemented. It's poetic justice.
I do agree that this season was rushed.
It needed more episodes to explain things in greater detail such as Lord Varys deserved a much better story line to his death. They really should have given it more time.
My analogy is this, you're writing a really great English paper and it's amazing and you're so enamored with the beginning and the middle of the story that all of the sudden you realize you need to wrap it up and finish. So its rushed and in the end you are hoping to at least earn a B- grade.
I like the way it ended it just needed more content and substance.",10,20 May 2019,9,21

3663,"Ok, I know I know that you are all upset guys but take a deep breath and chill..
this is the most convenient ending for the characters Jon didn't want the throne didn't want the North didn't want anything he choosed to be in the night's watch from the very first episode.and knowing he is a Targaryen didn't change his mind a bit for what he wants and let's all face it Jon Snow is a good warrior not a good ruler.
He killed Dany because this is the right thing to be done although he was confused about what's right this time. And again he choosed What is right despite all the consequences ( and at least we watched him pet Ghost) .
Arya didn't want to be a lady or any normal woman ever and she always asked what's in the west and now she is doing what she really wants and let's facing she is good in traveling to foreign countries. And she made a clear statement earlier that she won't go back north.
Sansa, she always wanted to be a queen and now she is. And people loves her for this.
Bran, for God's sake who do u think would be a good king among the remaining characters. It is logical to some extent.
Dany, I'll admit it I hate this character since the beginning of the show. She is only a lunatic dictator that was lucky enough to be so powerful and as deserve dying like this. And yes it is logical killing her like this and having no guards to protect her; since when she talks with Jon while she is surrounded with guards.
And one last thing why you don't like a happy ending for The Starks, guys they'll deserve it.
And everyone got what is suitable for him.

3672,"Daenerys character arc is what I refer to most of all as ""reaching its logical conclusion"". Having been worshipped by superstitious tribals and desperate slaves, she experienced a great degree of culture shock in the more civilized lands of westeros - where people understood what the dragons were, and how to combat them. She'd been murderhappy up until this point, killing people for so much as hurting her feelings - so naturally, when the people of westeros didn't drop at her feet worshipping her, she murdered them for it.With the characters realising that her murderous rampages weren't such a good thing when they were aimed at them, she was dealt with as you'd expect. This show was an excellent case of how a character would be seen as a hero in one culture, and nothing but evil in another - a showcase of chemistry between a character and their setting.As far as show endings go, this ending tied up all of the most important plot lines, and left the kingdom at peace, with its most pressing issues solved - for a time, at least.",10,15 February 2020,14,37

There's nothing to be disappointed about. Maybe in a couple of scenes there could have been more events leading there (and less teleport) but in general I don't see lack of logic and motivations.The sad truth of life is that some things end up much faster than we want them to, and are taking unplanned routes. So if a wall of bricks falls on your head you die doesn't matter were you just walking down the street or were trying to save your sister from the dragon.I've rewatched seasons 1-4 - well if you are looking at them through the haters lenses you will see there are so many illogical and rushed scenes, why didn't all they question them? The thing is that people knew there will be next season and then the next, and the books were there - so they were told what to expect. Now they were not - and everyone had its own ending in mind, well now you have to accept it's like this.

To me the eighth season was amazing and I feel like we got the best ending we could have hoped for.I never expected Game of thrones to have the perfect happy ending, it wouldn't be Game of thrones if it did and I feel like we got the closest to happy ending we could get.I do agree that some parts of the final season are a little rushed compared to the rest of the show but I also feel like they did the best they could. A final season has to try and tie up all the story lines and Game of thrones had quit a few.The final season felt like every other season to me.

The acting, writing, storyline, and multitude of characters with their own flare and distinct character make up, really made the show easy to jump right into. This show has it all and was great until season 8 and I, just like the majority feel the last season was extremely rushed and just thrown together. I don't know if it was pressure to get it filmed, maybe because the books are STILL NOT FINISHED, or the directors were motivated by money and wanted to move on to their next project. Whatever the reason I will say that the ending to this show is a slap in the face to the fans, actors, and anyone else that was involved with the show.

Like awful enough that it makes me never want to watch the coming prequel. Like I almost tweeted for the first time ever awful.
This review contains no spoilers. It's impossible to spoil something this bad.",1,20 May 2019,5,10
3729,"A person with even the slightest understanding of literature will see this ending as perfect.
The evil queen got to keep her throne forever: by being crushed beneath it.
The brother/lover got his wish in falling in her arms.
The wise one grew to appreciate and respect the consequences of his actions, and is sentenced to spend his life correcting the mistakes.
Sansa got her beloved throne, and in so protects her people.
Arya has won her battles and heads for a life of discovery.
The mad Queen is rightly slain after murdering countless innocents. There was no other way for this to go.
The wise one got the throne, because he's clearly the one who won't abuse it.
The hero saved the people by sacrificing what he loved. In true literary tradition, the hero does not need a throne, he lives among his people. Jon heading north for a life with the wildlings was the best possible ending for him.
I loved this series, and season 8 was superb.",10,20 May 2019,5,10
3730,"If they can wait two years to give us a final season, why not just wait for the books to be completed by Martin?I gave up on this show several years ago, because once the books finished, and terrible writers took over, the story lines died. What happened to shocking episodes? Like Jamie losing his hand, Ned losing his head, the bloodbath wedding? They all disappeared when the books ran out. And stereotypically boring Hollywood writers took over.I watched this last season because a friend informed me in 2018 that they'd seen bits of the Season 8 storyline, and what they told me sounded great! Unfortunately, they were wrong, and none of what they said came true. Instead we were held off for two years to receive this butchering of what was once great. My eyes are still burning.My main issues. The massive season by season build up to an epic fight with the white walker army comes down to one episode that felt like a mad rush to move on to the next battle against Cersei. The scenes were very dark and hard to figure out, a lot of the episode was pointless shots of Dany & Jon on dragons in the sky with little visibility. Bran went for a fly in a crow. Very helpful that, nice going son! Was there any sword fighting with the Night King & his closest soldiers? Nope, a lame attempt by Theon, then Arya easily kills him in two seconds. The fight was not well thought through. Of course your soldiers that die are going to be resurrected, maybe flame as much of the dead as possible to begin with? Instead of sending soldiers toward obvious death. It was a horrendous end to the huge build up against the dead army.Sam. Let's create a character who likes knowledge and loves to read. So he cures Jora of a nasty skin rash, and creates drama by telling Jon he read in Who Weekly that he's a Targaryen. That's it. Awesome. Maybe push him towards helping with all this reading? Maybe become something like a sorcerer? Help in this last episode, maybe kill Dany in revenge for his family? Nope, useless fatty cures skin infections and creates trouble. Plus a bunch of people die trying to save him. Waste of a character.Arya. Big build up to being the girl who can take people's faces, utilises it in the final season? Nope. Goes for a lengthy walk with the Hound to go kill Cersei, then Hound says you can leave and she immediately goes yeah okay, seeya. Then stares at a white horse for an eternity last episode, and disappeared this episode and she's still there in the rubble and ashes.Sansa. She's always been annoying, unlikeable. Are you seriously telling me that when she gets the poos that everyone's picking Bran as ruler on the throne, and says they'll be independent (so she can wear a pretty crown), no one else sitting there is going to have a problem with that?? In reality more of them would jump forward and go 'we'll be independent too!' But nope, Hollywood writers can't kill too many main characters, so let's just give them all a happy ending.Tyrion. I know he's little, but how many bullets can this dude dodge? It's ridiculous. Varys died, so should've this character. But nope....Hollywood writers! He's loved by fans, can't kill him.Bran. Can someone please tell me what he ever did that was helpful? He knew the white walkers were coming for him, maybe if you calculate it, he killed more people than Dany did in that last episode! And how is it right that he be ruler? Kids that acted the way he talks, in my school, would've got their heads flushed! And Sportsbet in Australia gave away he was ruler back in 2018, he was hot favourite. He has been nothing but a burden all the way. AND WASN'T EVEN IN A SEASON!Dany. Every season builds her up to be this strong dominant female.....ooh let's make her power hungry now, and kill her. The version i heard was she did NOT go crazy and kill a bunch of people, she was pregnant with Jon's baby, died giving birth. Baby (as it should've been) became ruler on the throne, because they actually have the right to be there. End of series.This season was horrendous, this finale episode was nightmarishly plain and boring. I miss Breaking Bad. I miss The Wire. I will never miss the final seasons of this bloodbath.

I miss the early days when GOT had true fans and not these young spoiled little brats that complain when things don't go according to their predictions. Or that their heroine/hero dies or becomes something they didn't want them to become. GOT doesn't care about your favorite characters or that life is fair or that this should happen. GOT, like life, is unpredictable and sometimes just ugly. There are some good moments that you get but plenty of what happens is out of people's control and sometimes things just suck. Yes this season was a little rushed but when watching this show all the way through I think maybe people will realize that these ratings/complaints were way too harsh.

3744,"Jon had to kill Dany, because it was very clearly that Dany will stop at nothing to make Sansa and Arya bend to her. Jon knows Dany will kill Sansa and Arya. Arya tells Jon she knows a killer when she sees one - and Dany is a mad killer. Tyrion tells Jon he must do something, and that Varys was right. Bran knew he was going to be King .. he is a seer .. he knows the future. The kingdoms elect Brand as King. Sansa asked Bran that the North is always independent, so Sansa becomes Queen of the North. Jon cannot be king, because he killed Dany and that will not stand for the Unsullied and Dothraky, so it is logical he becomes the next Maester Aemon .. Jon Snow becomes Master of the Night Watch and the new Ruler of the Wilding. John goes further to the North at the end .. a free man. Jon never wanted the Throne - that's not in his nature. Bran holds the memory of men as the three-eyed raven, and he is fit to be the King as a wise seer into the future.",10,20 May 2019,45,148
3745,"I am sure we can all agree that this season was extremely rushed by HBO for some reason. There were lots of mistakes. Cheesy dialogues which were meant to appeal to the general audience. Weak scripts that were not up to the standards we're used to seeing on Game Of Thrones. Scenes with plot armor so thick at times it insulted our intelligence.A decade long story came to an end, with most of its outcomes being the opposite of what majority of fans wanted to see. But isn't that what the show was all about? A show that defied the norm and surprised us at every corner. The only show that was truly successful in breaking the wheel.Daenerys has been our queen since the start of the show. We rooted for her. Stood by her side throughout her journey. We believed in her. And along the way we forgot that power can poison even the purest of hearts. We forgot that all of us have both good and bad inside of us. Its the part we chose to act on that defines us. But most importantly, its the people we surround ourselves with that help guide us. Dany lost everyone in the end. Family, friends, dragons and love. With all that gone she turned into the Mad Queen. She achieved her destiny in the end. But she was so blinded by power, so alone, that she could no longer tell right from wrong.John and Dany's scene was the best in the series. Seeing those two holding each other for the last time in a burnt castle next to the throne. Two people madly in love. True to their character till the very end. Dany's eyes beaming with joy and a taste of madness, dreaming of keeping her loved one by her side. John crying as he hopes he can avoid killing the woman he loves. If only she had given him a small sign of sanity, we would have had a completely different end to the story. Drogon's screams as he stood over Dany's corpse facing her killer. Only to realize that it was not John who took her life. It was the throne. A poisonous chair that destroyed his mother. This was pure poetry topped with the most beautiful cinematic shots ever seen. Eye candy at its finest.Tyrion has been outstanding throughout the series. Even at his worst, he always had good intentions. But what defined Tyrion was the fact that he was always able to create something out of nothing. How? Simply by talking his way out of everything. It was only fitting that he was the one to blabber the creation of a new election process and have a hand in choosing the future king. The last of the Lannisters, hand of the king, like his father before him. In the end, his talkative character enforces his final statement: ""Nothing is more powerful than a story""Even with him only appearing dead under a pile of rocks, Jaime Lannister still got the send off he deserves. Brienne, the only woman he ever loved besides Cersei, honored his memory. She fulfilled the wish he had shared with her a couple of seasons back. A wish of being able to conclude his epic story in the book of the King's Guards.Arya has always been adventurous. An independent and fierce character. She never gave in to what society expected from her as a lady. She is the embodiment of being true to yourself, no matter the circumstances. Going to discover what lies beyond Westeros was always going to be the perfect send off for her.Sansa has suffered the most throughout the series. This exact horror turned her into the strong, confident woman she is today. And unlike most of us, she knew that Dany was a killer from the moment she laid eyes on her. I think that's why many of us didn't value her as much in the end. But with Arya gone, John exiled, and Bran king, it was only fair that the last of Starks is to rule the North.John was always the simplest of them all. He never asked for titles. Never wanted fame. Nor money, nor power. He was always the one person that only cared about doing the right thing. An honorable man with the purest of hearts. Even with the love of his life in his arms and a chance to claim the world, he still chose the people over everything. He stuck to his morals and that led him right back to where it all started for his character, the real North. He was, is and always will be the main shield that guarded the realms of men. Its also fair to mention that Bran telling John he was always where he was meant to be, is one of the most heartwarming scenes in the episode.As for Bran, if we're being honest here I would have preferred someone else to sit on the throne. But then again who better than Bran to rule? A man who has access to thousands of years of history. Knowledge beyond limits. But most importantly, a soul disconnected from human imperfections. A soul that cannot be tainted by greed nor be blinded by power. This again highlights the fact that no real human is fit to rule the world. Because as much as we would like to fight it, we are creatures driven by emotions and that makes us weak and prone to error. Emotions that Bran no longer has. Bran the broken, long may he reign.I think if we overlook the rushed episodes and weak script, the series was concluded beautifully. And I am sure that no matter what the directors put for us on that screen, we would have never been satisfied. There is no joy in ending something so big that it has captivated our lives for the past decade. But unfortunately every journey has an end.Game Of Thrones is the best series in the world, and I doubt we will ever feel such a strong connection to a tv show anytime soon.Winter came and went, and we shall never see its like again.Ghass10",8,20 May 2019,11,28
3746,"These five words are the death penalty to Daenerys and even Drogon understands what Jon Snow aka Aegon Targaryan had to do. So in his pain he destroys the Iron Throne. The same Iron Throne Daenerys was so keen on sitting on it, it killed her and let her kill all these people. A Throne to rule them all which was too big even for a good-hearted ruler.
There is this saying from Spider-Man I think: with great power comes great responsibility. Daenerys had great power and she didn't use it responsibly.So, was this a good ending to a good story we all been watching for so long? Yes and no. I think we all wished for another ending filled with so many ideas in our heads we just forgot that this is great television. It was, it is and it will be. Has the ending flaws? Yes. Is the last season filled with plotholes and some character errors? Yes. But it doesn't change the fact that it has the heart of a yet unfulfilled story which George R. R. Martin didn't finish yet. It should have been longer. Just longer. A little bit longer that everybody can understand the wrongful power of Daenerys, the forbidden love between Dany and Jon/Aegon, the true meaning of the ""game"" and well, what the purpose of the White Walkers were.If anyone is thinking that George R. R. Martin didn't give his blessing and approval to this end and that it will be indeed in parts true to the upcoming story, well then they are just fools.In an imaginary world with a long history of wars between brothers and sisters, neigbours and friends, the end has a common wish for peace - without Night Kings, Dragons, Slaves...well, at least till the next winter is coming.And HBO and all the guys did open so many doors for so many sequels, spin-offs and reboots..it is without question that we will see them in any way or another in a television galaxy far far away ;)Arya - Dawn of a New World

3747,I saw the last episode one hour ago in the cinema. It was phenominal and the right ending for the last characters who survived season 8 till now. For all the haters: get a life and write (and finish 😉) your own bestseller.,10,20 May 2019,11,28
3748,"You bovines are mad because the throne ended up not mattering in a series that beat us over the head with the throne doesn't matter from day one. Smh.Jon was told who he was NOT because he had a right to the throne, but because Bran knew that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and Jon having a claim would help diminish Daenerys. Even benevolent dictators become evil eventually. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. That was the ENTIRE POINT of the show, and you are mad that the finale focused on it?Daenerys was an idealist who believed she alone knew what ""just"" meant (ask Selmy about it when Daenerys violates the Geneva Conventions after he suggested repaying injustice with mercy). All dictators eventually become infamous, even the good intentioned ones, because they believe they have some sort of divine mandate to rule. If you'd walked out of a fire with three dragons, you'd be convinced of it too.THAT is the ENTIRE POINT of the show.So NO, this was never going to end with the ""rightful heir"" on the throne. It was ALWAYS going to end with the throne being destroyed and some form of a compromise government replacing the system it started with.
Only complete morons are mad at the WHAT of the ending. If your complaint is the execution, that's different. But if you are mad at what happened, you are simply dumb.
And that is true of every major arc, because each one ended appropriately in service to the main themes of the show since day one. The futile pursuit of power should never pay off for the people, and people don't ever fully change just because they are important characters in a show, or because they face extreme circumstances. They just have certain latent traits amplified.These are the lessons the show tried to teach from the first episode.The main one? ""When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die"" was a LIE. The truth is this: ""when you play the game of thrones, EVERYONE loses."" That was the point, and it's why the only character who isn't really human ends up on the throne: humans cannot be trusted to rule without checks and balances. Hence why going forward a representative democracy would be the backbone of the government.Everything about the ending served the main lesson and theme from the show. You being mad about it is just because you missed the entire point.",10,20 May 2019,20,58
3749,"I liked the show since the very beginning. I honestly don't understand why people rating it so low. One, they might not understand how Game of Thrones work. Two, they are not so-called true fans.""When you are playing the game of thrones you either win or die""- Cersei Lannister. Both good and bad rulers and seen the downfall when they are ruling the seven kingdoms. Same goes to Dany. I know she deserves better but at the end she was going to destroy all with fire and blood. Jon Snow aka Aegon had to go back to wall, thats what he always wanted to be a free man.One might think that all this is Brandon's plan all along. It maybe true or false. He knew the past, so I dont think he will be a bad ruler for the seven kingdoms. Sansa always wanted the North to be an independent kingdom. I truly think after all this the North and Sansa deserves this. As for Arya, I hope she discovers something cool, this might be the next sequel and all but not keeping my hopes high. Great Finale for Ghost. Tears overflowing for Drogon who lost everything.It broke my heart when Grey Worm wanted to go to the Isle of Naath the birth place of Missandei. I will nice to see them together. As for Brienne, she finished Jaime's story, it left most of the watchers sobbing. Perfect ending when Jon goes into the north of the wall, it how the show started in 2011 when the riders entering the north of the wall.Loved this ending! Actors were extraordinary. People are giving low points for now reason at all. Watch it from the first, binge watch it again, all makes sense. Farewell, Dany. Farewell, Game of Thrones.

The acting was superb as always, and despite popular opinion I think D&D did very well with this season, tying it back with previous seasons as well as they did. I thought Danny's fall to madness was done very well and if that was a shock to you then you really weren't paying attention.

They have been preparing us that Dany is not that good from the start but they viewed it from a different angle to make fans love her. People do mistakes and in this show there are no second chances. Either take the story as it or go watch a show that fits your dreams and family reunions with happy endings with disney birds flying around.
All fans who vote (1/10) are you serious? How come? You don't know how hard it is to make such a show.. Music, production, customes, CGI.... etc its never been about the story though it's a great one with many sacrifices.
All I can say is that even with the law rating of the last couple of episodes, people are talking about this show all the time. Besides, number of audience who vote are way more than average fans of other shows which indicates who successful it is despite law ratings of amateurs.

Tyrion was right naming bran the king as he is the memory of the world and he is the wisest one amongst them. That's what tyrion always aimed for, some one who could rule wisely and who is wiser than the three eyed raven? For me it feels Jon is brought back to life as his role is in uniting fire and ice against the white walkers and saving the world from darkness let it be death or fire. A stark holding the north the north, a stark holding the south and 6 kingdoms and a half stark/half targaryan holding the region beyond the wall.

In regards to final episodes and the satisfaction they bring, I think Lost went on for two seasons too many, GoT probably 10 episodes too short. Breaking Bad was perfect. I enjoyed them all. GoT was great. I watched it all the way through for the second time in anticipation of this final season and thinking back much of the character choices made in the last 6 episodes are pretty consistent. Rushed?

Bad, unsatisfying and it leaves this bitter taste in your mouth that spoils all the future rewatches for you. It was a living and breathing world once but now it's just some bad fan fiction exploring the question no one asked: ""what would happen if all of the characters had meningitis complications"". Characters are killed off just to raise the body count, years of careful character development are traded for some shock value, some plot lines just go nowhere... yup, it's really bad.Bad, confusing and so, so disappointing.

3801,"Personally, I have only read the first two books in the series, and I chose to stop reading them, because I wanted to finish the show first (which I had already started upon starting the books). I plan on finishing the books now that the show is finished.But I understand that a television series in not like a book at all. Truly great writing leaves a lot up to the imagination, which is true of the books that I read. However, great television is a bit of a different story, and while the finale could have been better, it was a far cry from a 1, or 2 out of 10.There is nothing wrong with how this show ended. It was grand, tragic, and quite the spectacle. Something that a book would have a harder time pulling off. Which leads me to my main counterpoint against people who trash this show...
The problem here lies in how people blend what they know about the books and lore, with a standalone adaptation for screen. They simply are seperate entities...This is not to say that this season was entirely great, it definitely feels rushed. They should have had at least a few more episodes to build things up.But I can't stand it when nerds who can't seem to seperate the simplist of things, a book series, and an adaptation of that series, ""criticize"" the show for not being what they wanted or expected, based on the source material.To these people, all I have to say this: You need to find something better to do with your time.This is a seperate work from the books, and you fail to see that, and objectively critique it on that basis.You're wasting your time watching this show if you expect it to turn out exactly like George Martin's book series. It just wasn't going to happen.WAIT FOR THE BOOK TO COME OUT. And enjoy it for what it is. A much more detailed medium to tell a long winded story. But if you're looking for a book story from a television show, then you're not watching a show to enjoy it. You're looking for something that isn't there. Of course you are going to be dissapointed.That's all I want to say, I watch this show to enjoy it for what it is. A television show that in the long run, ended in quite a satisfactory way. After all, this was a story about the Starks and the Lannisters in the end.
And I thought they had some great nods in this final episode to our lives and democracy as a whole.Overall, not a perfect conclusion, but one that satisfied me just fine.I'm looking forward to the books which will obviously be more in depth.",10,20 May 2019,8,19

As someone who rated ep3, ep4, ep5 as 1 star ( Could not stand the bots which rated 10 stars because no way those episodes deserved more than 6) to be consistent I will gladly rate this episode 9 stars.-----------------I believe I was one of the harshest critics of Game of Thrones. After watching the final episode I feel rather blue that this series end and end in such a way it will not be remembered with respect.I want to thank everyone who took part in any stage of production until season 6, it was by far the best TV series we ever had and possibly we will ever have. It was near perfection in any sense.Having watched many times from start to end I believe I will at least watch at least twice more. It was much more than a mere ""Game of Thrones"" its depth, philosophy, character development and impeccable acting... It has already become the cornerstone of the TV industry.Then comes the season 6, enjoyable yet avid fans could catch some inconsistencies they are not content with.Then comes season 7,even people who are slightly familiar with the books and asoiaf universe started to get irritated ;however, its soundtracks, effects and acting were still WAY better than that of many prominent TV series.Sad to say, then the final season comes, I watched many HBO series and I genuinely feel that this season has the WORST writing than any season of any series HBO ever presented. On the other hand it has the BEST visual effects.Yes time leaps became the norm of the Game of Thrones ;however, this episode made much more sense compared the other episodes of season 8. The problem was not how the things turned out, it was the way they depicted.> There was no way Jon could get away with murder of Dany when most of the dothraki and unsullied were alive ( Do not ask me how they duplicate I do not know :) )> We would not be content with Sansa, Sam, Davos, Yara or any other to be King or Queen ( Bran has the most gravity among them despite their horrible depiction of S8 Bran)> With Jon gone, there was no one better than Sansa to rule the north.> Arya marrying Gendry would kill character development of Arya ( It is way better outcome for her to explore outside of westeros)> Sam, Bronn, Davos, Podrick and Brienne they all were granted important positions in the new era of Westeros.> Given the character of Jon, real north suits him perhaps the best.Although, I am immensely disappointed with season 8 I will still miss Game of Thrones.",7,20 May 2019,7,16

Just watch it, not with prejudice you'll be reading in here on iMdb, cause honestly fans have been the worst to deal with, D&D has defeated the white walkers but being attacked by such a fanbase is sth else, and to all the fams who didn't like the ending, just because something doesn't end in a way you wanted doesn't make it necessarily bad written nor disappointing. It feels like people have grown a tendency of criticizing GoT with popular belief and kinda got so used to it that it blockades their true thoughts on a truly great episode. Chill people or don't, I don't care really, all I want to do is to remember this episode as just the way it is. Emotional and satisfying (not because it met my expectations but mainly because it didn't at all and still managed to shock me cause that's what GoT is all about not meeting expectations only to raise the branches above...)",10,20 May 2019,45,151
3817,Why did D&D decide to finish the series in just 8 seasons when GRRM and HBO wanted them to continue? Why didn't they just give it to other writers if they didn't want to work on GOT anymore? Why did WE have to suffer with such a bad ending just because D&D wanted to get the hell away from Game of Thrones?,1,12 June 2019,3,5
3818,"The last episode as well as the big part of the last season of the catastrophe (above all, I mean the scenario).
To argument (focus on the last episode): Tyrion's finds Jaime and Cersei dead in -the only place where we see a pile of bricks that if they would have stand in any other part of the room would have survived.
By some kind of magic there is more and more Unsullied and Dothraki in each of the following episodes.
What did Ary do at King's Landing ?! To escape from the fire and falling buildings and to tell Jon that Daenerys was evil after Daenerys had burned the whole city and killed hundreds of thousands of innocents. The most important thing - what happened to the horse on which he rode at the end of the 5th episode.
Then we have Tyrion (after he is arrested) that explains to Jon that Daenerys became evil (since Jon apparently had trouble understanding this), Jon said that he would not even try to justify what Daenerys did, and then a second later he tried to justify what Daenerys did.
Daenerys panics all the time because of the threat that Jon as Targaryen and the legitimate heir for the throne and knowingly stays with the biggest threat completely alone in the Throne Room without a single guard (if we neglect Drogon down at the entrance).
Then a time jump I guess a few weeks after Jon killed Daenerys - why did Unsullied, first of all, the Gray Worm did not kill Jon on the spot when he found out? Jon killed the only remaining person he cared for. It's literally a couple of hours before that, that he is turning the neck to the unarmed prisoners on the street.Then the council - all agreed that Bran would be a new king without a guile, they would meet each time the king dies and decide who will be next (this is not the only way to do so), Stark is a new king but Sansa wants independence for the North because no one of the northerns wants to be a rules by iron throne anymore, so they would later kneel at her when she is ""crowned""? Nobody else gets this ( Dorn, Yara Greyoy ...) are not scared of it and do not seek independence for its province. Jon is ""condemned"" to the night watch to calm Gray Worm, then in the next scene we see the Unsullied as they are ready take the ship to Nath ,and no longer want to have business with King's Landing and the Seven Kingdoms.
Then we also have a short scene of Dothraki who carefree walk and look completely assimilated in the streets of King's Landing (Dothraki, who in their description raped and robbed everything and everybody wherever they went and only Danereys kept them in check while still alive).
Btw how much time has passed since King's Landing was devastated ?? !! Towards the end of the episode it is quite up-to-date and full of life.
Why do Wildlings come back far to the North if lands that were promised to them are to the south of the wall where land is better and food is easier cultivated ?!
Why is there Night Watch if Night King is killed and you are good with Wildlings ?? !!
There's still a lot, but I think that's enough.
I do not understand how somebody can say that this season os ok, almost very episode is in anti logic loop including the end Bran is season 7, I can t be a Lord of anything , Bran in the end os season 8, I l take what I can get... sure, I l be the King.

Jon, who has always fought for justice and the ""right thing"", never really thinking about politics and consequences, tries to justify Dany's actions?! Lord Varys spreading the word about Jons true identity and it even doesn't get mentioned once during the election of the new king? Arya becoming the next Galileo Galilei? Bran after getting elected as king just sais ""why do you think I came here?"".

In the end, Game of Thrones was just...more like a conventional tv show with a great budget, and less the complex, intricate study of power and the human condition that we saw in the beginning. How will we eventually judge it, in the end? Like Daenerys, the show itself faltered at the height of its power and never regained its footing in season 8.My wish!
I wish King Bran's first order of the day was to find Meera Reed and Thank her properly! Meera Reed, warrior and Queen-of-dragging-Bran-for-years! Dear Meera....We remember, even though Bran and the showrunners forgot you along with good storytelling.",4,21 May 2019,3,5

Now when D&D want to take out a major character like Dany, they let her turn mad in one episode, and in the next you see her wander the throne room without guards, with Jon walking up with his weapons at his belt. Everyone knew beforehand what was coming then, just except the characters themselves. Before, with GRRMs writing, the show was always smarter than the audience. No way I could have guessed the beheading of Ned or the Red Wedding. Now the audience is smarter than the show. The ""plot twists"" are just cheap, unlogical or made up. Arya coming out of nowhere and kills the Night King? Sure. Rhagal shot down by 10 super scorpions, while in the next episode 500 scorpions were useless? Sure.

Near faultless performances from our favourites - Cleganebowl and Peter Dinklage standout - and the cinematography was exceptional. Thank you for the decade long experience of this television series.However, this finale simply does not suffice. In fact, this entire final season has felt like a terrible nightmare that I hope Catelyn Stark was will wake up from and somehow we will be back in the days of season one. It really feels like the writers sold the show and it's fans out for the quickest wage packet they could receive. Game of Thrones simply does not end with characters sailing off into the sunset like some cheesy Netflix Original. The complexities of the storytelling and character development were thrown away quicker than Drogon flying off into distance. For Daenerys to hastily die before a quick cut to ad break is ridiculous. Bran's sudden change of heart towards inheriting the throne is plain frustrating, perhaps the writers even sold out to the bookmakers on that one. Also, the edge of comedy in the final scenes at the table of Bran's council felt like it was mocking my investment into this, I felt like Bronn was laughing as he cynically slapped me across the face. These are just slices of what should have been an emotional resolution, one that I lost interest in as the episode prolonged.I genuinely expected to have tears in my eyes as I watched the final shots of my favourite television series but in reality I lost my attachment to this once great show - something that cannot be erased and will tarnish my memory of Game of Thrones.",1,20 May 2019,3,5

You can tell that the build up was right there for him to be Azor Ahai, for him to fight the night king.

3840,"...and there is nothing more painful than a bad ending.When Tyrion mentioned the importance of a good story I couldn't help but feel D&D were giving us the finger. GoT had its ups and downs from the beginning, with the ups greatly outweighing the downs. Well, at least up until season 7 when a suicide squad of a dozen people decided to go beyond the wall and face TENS OF THOUSANDS of undead. Even worse, they succeeded. That was the turning point. Sense, logic, coherence and boldness - everything that had once made this show the best thing I'd ever seen on television - were thrown out the window and gave way to stupidity, laziness and ever thickening plot armor. When those guys went north, the show went south. Not having George's original material is one thing - turning a thoughtful, carefully crafted and character-driven story into ridiculous bombast you need to switch off your brain for is another.After season 7's disappointing storytelling I did not expect much from season 8. I was worried six episodes would not be enough to bring this story to a proper, decent close. I was worried the story would move too quickly and leave no time for the relatable development of characters' decisions, something that once was a trademark of GoT. I hoped I'd be proven wrong. I wasn't.The stakes were high, the fall was deep. The crash was disastrous. I was in love with this show. I was sure this was gonna be the thing I'd rewatch thirty years from now. Now I'm pretty sure I'll never watch it again, knowing it all leads to this final joke. It's a shame.Let's all hope GRRM finishes the books someday. He does not deserve this show's ending to go down as the final chapter of the fascinating universe he created.",1,20 May 2019,3,5

Too many questions and not enough explanation and character build up.
Especially Bran, the person who eventually became a king of the 6 kingdoms (because only 6 out of 7 kingdoms were cool with it), was the least developed character.

Is he actually the real villain that wanted the throne all along? - maybe, we will never know because it wasn't explained or lead to in the character development.Very disappointed, all is left now is to hope that George R.R.

3867,"I've watched this show from the beginning, turned my mom and girlfriend into diehard fans even though they have no interest in fantasy. That's the type of show GOT was, you could look past the dragons and magic and still find something to peek your interest. The decision to condense the final 2 seasons makes zero sense in hindsight. There was so much material that was hardly touched which made the pace of the last 2 seasons really make no sense at all. What did johns lineage even mean in the end? Arya becoming a faceless man just to kill walder Frey? Bran becoming the 3 eyed raven. He apparently was this big threat to the night king but what did he actually do? Years and years of buildup on all these characters journeys and it's like D&D just said ""ok here we are at A, how do we get to Z the quickest and cheapest way"". I mean the long night, which was the center plot of most of the show for 8 seasons, lasted........one night lol. I mean come on. I understand the white walkers weren't gonna be the end all of the show but seriously? And then the ending, by god the ending. No one expected a happy ending, that wasn't GOT style, I expected a somber ending, somehow they managed to make it not happy, and not bittersweet, just kind of bland. The dialogue in the last episode was so cheesy and annoying. Nothing satisfying about John killing dany. 8'3 at least kept you on the edge of your seat the whole episode, and Arya killing the night king, and how it happened was satisfying. Have to admit that's the last time I felt satisfied the whole season. The rest of it just came off as bland, predictable, and frankly disappointing. The bigger they are the harder they fall I suppose. GOT was a pop culture phenomenon similar to Star Wars, and they found a way to screw it up.",1,20 May 2019,3,5

3870,The episode is a foreshadowing to the white walkers symbol when all the characters are dead in a weird shape and no one knows how or when or why it happened.,1,20 May 2019,3,5
3871,"The writers were stupid on so many levels, it's just tragic. I'll list them in order or importance:1. Theme - The writers completely forgot that the entire theme of Game of Thrones--the thing that made it great--was that Life Isn't Fair. Sometimes good people have bad luck. Sometimes doing the right thing leads to tragic consequences. It's what made the first few seasons of the show great. But here in the last season, every ""good"" character is invincible or, receives exactly the death they would want.2. Characters -The writers forgot all the personalities, motivations, experiences and traits of all the characters. Once brilliant characters are now idiots, once decisive characters are now unable to reach obvious decisions, once empathetic characters are now psychopaths. No development to get there... just characters suddenly being different.3. Dialog - Show used to be witty, subtle, and smart. Now every character just says exactly what is on their mind in plain, boring English. Mostly the characters just narrate obvious story elements that viewers already know... because I guess they thought we'd be too stupid understand what we've been watching.4. Internal Logic - There is no consistency to anything in the final season. Entire armies are obliterated, only to reappear in the next episode. Weapons that are undefeatable in one episode are utterly useless in the next. Traveling to places used to take entire seasons, now it happens instantaneously. Every character is just magically where they need to be to move the story along.5. Plot holes - Entire series-long plots are dropped without a single word. SPOILER: Jon Snow's plot arc is dropped unforgivably in final episode. Everyone has been pushing him to do the deed and take the throne... but as soon as he does the deed, and they get together to decide who takes the throne... they don't even consider him. I cannot understate how amazingly inept this writing is on this point.I could go on and on, but my point is this: Game of Thrones could have been the greatest television series of all time, had George RR Martin completed the books, and been given creative control... MAYBE. Some of the plot points themselves seem unforgivably stupid... maybe that's on Martin himself... or maybe he could have gotten us to the same spot in an artful, sensible way. Our only hope is that Martin finishes the series with the ending it deserves, and maybe he will even make some corrections based on the fan reaction to some of the seemingly unsalvageable plot points.",1,20 May 2019,3,5
3872,"Honestly, if you haven't seen any GoT, just stop watching after season 6. The show falls off the rails at that point.The scene in which they are sitting around deciding who will be king absolutely neglects Jon Snow's claim to the throne. (But, but, but, Greyworm is grumpers! So what, there are tons of Westerosi people that would wreck the Unsullied)Bronn being the Master of Coin neglects the fact that a few episodes ago he threatened Tyrion and Jamie with a crossbow and blackmails them. Ah shucks, well please sit down by me hired assassin that was going to kill me and my beloved brother.Drogon sees Jon with his knife in Dany and somehow decides not to hurt him after one episode ago destroying an entire city. Apparently Drogon didn't really care about his mother because Jon has plot armor.Once again, we see no emotional reactions from characters throughout the whole episode since no one really cares about anything that happens and if we saw emotions we would actually care about the show, which is contrary to the writers' goal of making us hate the show.This season really is a gigantic waste of time.

Except, you had to force a comical villain ""Mad Queen"" Dany and kill her inconsistent character.(Mad Queen is consistent in the books but not the show).This is total garbage and renders the entire first few seasons meaningless for a re-watch. This is not how you execute a classic. LOTR is a classic because the payoff and overall plot is almost perfect. GoT is now garbage!",1,20 May 2019,3,5

The characters certainly do not look that much older since the utter destruction of the Red Keep, which left it in ash and rubble. The civilians certainly repopulated quite quickly. Please send my compliments to the builders of Westeros.What also happened to Jon's lineage? And all the people who supported and vowed to stand by him, including his family? It just seemed more logical that him killing Danny should be celebrated instead of condemned, you know, after she murdered almost every living thing in King's Landing, and publicly proclaimed that she will 'liberate' a.k.a. do the same to the other kingdoms of Westeros. You guys made Jon went from hero to zero to wait-what-was-his-name-again? reeaaallly quick.Bran as the new king is... perhaps the biggest question of all. So... what was all that character development and arc of the Three-eyed Raven about? What is even the role and purpose of the Three-eyed Raven? Wasn't Bran the one who revealed that Jon is the true heir to the Iron Throne? What is happening guys?I have a lot more questions, but I guess they will never be answered. I used to enjoy the show and your brilliance, but your lack of care and effort for good story-telling in the past two seasons have become too glaring to ignore.

Pros: The visual effects are amazing and the acting is superb(especially Peter Dinklage). Jon petting Ghost was also a long awaited scene.
Cons: Everything in the episode was predictable and mundane. Even Dany's death was cliche. Her ending is so stupid and without build up. It could have worked if they were planning for her to become that mad with the correct build up but they rushed and ruined it. Bran is useless and didn't do anything this season and they make him king anyways. Jon's plotline doesn't matter anymore and everyone forgot about him later.

Why does no one react to the fact that Jon is the rightful heir to the iron throne? All this time there was an anticipation on Varys, Tyrion and Sansa's behalf to become King, and after he kills Dany, why does no one care about his claim to the throne anymore?
Why do the Unsullied accept a new King without revolting? Their queen has just been killed and that is their reaction?
What kind of an ending is that for Jon?
What arch is Bran's that led to him becoming King?These are just a few examples of the poor writing on this season. I have been a GoT enthusiast since the first episode of the first season and I genuinely feel heartbroken. This ending was pathetic. Nothing makes sense. There was no development towards this ending. GoT was known to have the best writing ever seen on Television, with creative character development, progressive plots and uncertainty about character's fate. This season is ridiculous, it completely destroyed the foundations on which GoT was based. Having a sad ending is perfectly fine, Breaking bad and Spartacus were series that ended in a tragedy, but they were amazing! Epic! Why? Because the development justified the outcome.

Well , that's fine but what about the whole build up of 8 seasons and waiting time of 2 years between 7th and season ?The worst part is , after 3 episodes of season 8 ,the show was aimless.Still I regard #GOT as one of the best TV series of all time and you must watch it.",5,20 May 2019,3,5

Where the drogon goes? What about the dario naharis and all? I know got means unexpected turns but not such disgusting turns. Writers totally messed up all the characters. Even fan theories are better than D&D theory. They really rushed up all the things.
Why they take 2 years to make this...?? And jon the emerging character lead to nothing.. Why does he reborn just to kill dany (not acceptable). What about the no one God and all?
Conclusion : we expect greater things but what we get is some below average story. I used repeatedly watch every season episode and every reaction video on the youtube but s8 onwards not anymore.

In reality, the way it was presented to the audience, it might as well be a 90s soap opera because that's how it ended. Only 2 good scenes by comparison to the rest. Drawn out scene to lengthen the episode. Instead of greater mysteries which they made disappear this season, insignificant details are catered to, such as Jaime's section in the KG's history book (which was nice) but that was the focus - the audience's emotions for characters - not a well told story which gets you thinking. No twists, just exactly what you're thinking when you watch it. My overall rating: Willneverrewatchorrecommendtoanyone/10",1,20 May 2019,3,5

This episode was ridiculous.To show Dany as Mad Queen they asked her to pop open her eyes a bit more. Ridiculous.Her speech in front of the Unsullied and Dothraki was sooooo not Dany.Conversation between Jon and Tyrion, oh my god! Jon says he is NOT going to justify her actions and guess what? A minute later he tries to justify her actions. Stupidest writing.Then he goes on to kill Dany. A new queen without any bodyguards. God damn it! There were more Unsullied guarding outside the room where Tyrion was locked in. But in a semi burned Red Keep where a jump might shake the towers Dany is walking alone admiring the wreckage she created.And oh my god with Drogon! Give me one good reason why Drogon didn't burn Jon? Coz he's a Targaryen? I would have believed it more if Drogon burned him and he emerged from the dragon fire! Stupidity!And then there's a time jump! Ohhhh my god! We don't know how Jon was captured. The last two episodes Greyworm's character arc has turned 180 degrees. If any of the Unsullied captured Jon, they would have executed him. Give me another good reason why Jon was captured but not executed? For heavens sake, Greyworm was executing Lannister soldiers on the street just because they were Dany's enemies. What would he do to the one who killed Dany?
Please let the characters act like the characters they act!And then there's the horrendous council meeting! Omg! I won't even start talking about how abysmal the script for this scene was. All the unnecessary characters gather together and... oops sorry! I'm not gonna be a Jon.And Jon joining Nights Watch? Meeting Tormund? Petting Ghost? Who cares if Sansa is the Queen in the North? Who cares if Arya is going west of Westeros? U dumb girl. U go west of Westeros, you reach east of Essos! I don't care!Unnecessary!I've been watching this show since 2012.

I kind of wish I could do the same to this episode and people who wrote it that don't particularly care about fans as much as their next paycheck, as she did to kings landing... Seeing them burn for what they've done to this show in the end would be more satisfying than watching any part of that episode...

3985,"I don't think you people know what a 1/10 entails. 1/10 means completely unsatisfying. Complete garbage. Comparative to the worst thing ever made. As a huge fan of this show, I'm going to give my honest review.Seasons 1-6 were incredible. The slow build up, the genius dialogue and storytelling. The shocking moments that nobody saw coming. The peak of this show.Season 7 felt a little sloppier. There were many moments that were rushed or felt like nonsense (""bring the dead to her"").Season 8... I have complete mixed feelings for season 8. There are a ton of things wrong with it, mainly starting with the aftermath of The Long Night. The Last of the Starks wasn't good. There were so many character regressions and stupid plot twists that didn't make any sense (Shooting down the dragon while flying over the water. They should've seen the fleet for sure). And then The Bells. The episode overall was great because of the acting, cinematography, etc. but the issue that Dany burnt hundreds of thousands of people out of nowhere after they surrendered was a poor choice for writing her character. And Cersei's death was rather anti-climactic.Which brings me to the finale. No, it wasn't the most perfect thing ever to air, but to rate it as a 1/10 is a bit extreme. The acting was great, Daenerys's death scene with Drogon nudging her and then burning the throne and flying off with Dany was devastating and beautiful. Bran being the King is definitely an odd choice, but also an understandable one. Jon didn't come into any power, like he wanted, Tyrion still got to be hand, Brienne and Pod became kingsguard, Jaime's good deeds were finally filled out, Sansa rules the north, Sam is grand maester. JON. PET. GHOST. Everything is tied up fairly neatly. Everyone is fairly happy with the outcome. What more could you people want? I don't understand. It's such a shame that so many people are claiming that this great series had a 1/10 series finale when that's absolutely not the case",10,20 May 2019,51,174
3986,"I'm an emotional wreck at the moment. While this isn't the ending GRRM is likely to use for the books. That doesn't mean the show's version was by any means terrible. On the contrary, in the context that was set up from the get go I think it concluded quite nicely.WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD. STOP READING IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED!!!

Dany had to die. I loved her since Eps 01 S01. Emilia Clarke won me over with her portrayal of the character. And the books only further deepened that love. But, the more I thought about it. Especially over the course of the seasons. Dany has evolved as a character. We don't see it as clearly because its directed towards the likes of slavers, slave masters and ruthless men who deserved her wrath. We cheered this on happily because these men were monsters. We never took into account of the darkness that was growing in Dany as time progressed. It's a tragic development that displays the sad truth about unquestionable power placed in the hands of a few. After all, when faced with constant evil its so easy to forget that even the road to hell itself was once paved with good intentions. And when a person commits an act of cruelty in the name of the greater good. He/she is empowered by such an act through the justification. Soon one act becomes two, two becomes three and so on. Before you know it, the lines of morality is blurred and everything you do, right or wrong is justified. This is the tragically poetic truth of Daenerys Stormborn, of the House Targaryen. When she began her journey many years ago, she did so with only the best of intentions at heart. But the world is a cruel and cold place. And there is only so much the heart can take before it gives in to the darkness. By the end of her journey she had achieved everything she'd ever dreamed. But at the cost of turning into very thing she swore she would never become. While a part of me holds out for a more hopeful ending for her arch in the books. Here in the show it concluded tragically beautiful. A bittersweet end to a marvelous beginning.While some might not be happy with Jon going into exile. I'm satisfied with this ending. Jon never wanted to rule. He never wanted a King's title or to claim his birthright as King of the Seven Kingdoms. That was never him. He may have the blood of a Targaryen in him but he was always a northerner at heart. And he was always happiest not just in the north. But the true north beyond the wall. He saved the realm twice. Once from the Night King and the army of the dead. And once more doing the thing that was hardest. Killing that which he loved. Maester Aemon once said that ""Love is the death of duty"", but so is duty the death of love. Jon had been tested by the fates twice with duty and love. Once with Ygritte, when he had to choose between saving his brothers of the nights watch, or being with his true love. He chose duty over love. And again with Dany. For which, the realm itself will never know the sacrifice he's made for them. He's not the hero the realm deserves. Nor will he be remembered. But its okay because Jon has never wanted songs or stories told about him. The world will eventually forget him, but the free folk will never forget the crow who saved them from the dead.Tyrion is a brilliant man, but also a heavily flawed man at that too. He's made mistakes and lost in win all or lose all scenarios on more than one occasion. But in the end, his actions have brought on a completely new era for the realm by backing Bran. With an elective monarch chosen every time the king or queen passes. It ensures that no one house rules for an undetermined amount of generations. It also establishes a form of democracy to the realm that keeps the wheel permanently broken and may evolve as time carries on. The real irony of Tyrion is that for years Tywin Lannister has regarded his son as the imp who brought shame to House Lannister. And yet in the end. It is Tyrion of all Lannisters that restored respect and honor to House Lannister serving as Hand. On a slightly humorous note. I find it kind of funny that Tyrion and Tywin both served as Hands to the Targaryen dynasty. And both are responsible for seeing their King/Queen die through their actions after the city was sacked. Tywin had Jaimie. And Tyrion had Jon. The only difference is Tyrion has a heart ad believes in mercy. His father did not.I'm glad to see Sansa sit the northern throne as queen in the north. Regardless who sat the iron throne I never imagined for one second that she would want to return to King's Landing to stay. Maybe she did at one point when she was a girl dreaming of prince and princesses. But the cruelty and backstabbing she endured there left its mark. The only time I'd imagine she'd ever return there was for something like this. Otherwise her true home is the north among her countrymen and women. And now she'll drive the north into a new golden age sovereignty, free to determine its fate. I'm happy with this conclusion to her story arch.I'm also happy with the conclusion to Jaimie arch through Brienne. As new captain of the King's Guard. She ensured that history will remember Ser Jaimie for more than his King Slayer days. They will remember his heroic acts as well.Last but not least. I think Arya's ending felt fitting. She was never going to settle down and become someone's lady. That's never been her. She is an adventurer. Always has been, always will be. The only Stark in living memory to sail across the sea to Essos. The only Stark to see life beyond Westeros. And now she will be the first Stark to see what is truly west of Westeros.Overall. This isn't the ending I had expected. Nor is it the ending I expect GRRM's books to go. But in the context of the series itself. The show ended in the best possible way. And I enjoyed every minute of it. A solid end to a solid beginning.",10,20 May 2019,31,99

Throughout the series, he had one of the most interesting character arcs and story line (in my personal opinion). Everything would have made sense if the showrunners expanded the last three episodes into one season each. Regardless, I am truly upset that the show is over. I won't ever feel the same attachment to another show. Just want to appreciate the show for what is was. There's too much negative energy around this and I just want to show my love for GoT.

I knew a couple seasons ago that Daenarys was going mad.. if you actually watch the show you'll see it too.. the writing is elegant. Apparently too elegant for most of the world to understand and appreciate the art of it. Obviously Daenarys was not going to get the throne, that is too easy and again, obvious. Jon, too obvious of an ending to put him on the throne. After that, who else more fair and just and wise than Bran to rule? Its fitting. Sansa has always wanted to he Queen but she was obviously not going back to Kings Landing where most of her childhood was spent being terrorized. Arya said many times she's no lady and never will be. People need to give the show more credit but they won't because if I'm being honest.. most people who watch shows.. don't have an ounce of talent or art in their body.. the LACK of brains it would take to demand D&D and HBO to completely rewrite the final season is just downright laughable and sad at the same time. If you can't find a way to love the ending then do what the people who loved The Sopranos did. Get over it because it's a tv show, not life.",10,20 May 2019,48,164

4000,"I am no movie critic, nor a long term GoT fan, but this tv series was hands on the best tv series I have ever seen, and even though the final season didn't live up to the hype. However, every single detail of the show was perfect, the actors, the stunts, the effects and so on. Even though it was far from being the best ending it could have been, the directors tried to fit an enormous amount of story in only 6 episodes. I wish it continued, but this is it. So let's appreciate what we have received so far and not hate on every single detail, just because it didn't happen the way fan theories wanted to.
Hope you all have a great day!",10,20 May 2019,28,89

4006,"Unpopular opinion but i liked this episode. Besides the scene where Dany was killed which was surprisingly emotionless and the whole dialogue with Jon Snow before that was cringy, everything made sense. Don't get me wrong, I think that it was a good choice to kill her (what were the other options, Dany becomes good again and rules with Jon? that's not GoT, or she burns everything down?), it's just the way it happened was a bit off. Jon's ending was good: no title and he got to see the wildlings walk past the wall safely (+ he was reunited with Ghost); Tyrion is where he should be: giving wise advice and has his crew to help him; Sansa queen in the North is so cool, I never though about the possibility of Winterfell remaining independent; Arya will keep on exploring and remain the free spirit who doesn't conform to anything or anyone. All in all, Bran becoming king also makes sense. He is the only one who won't make irrational decisions driven by his own agenda. He is the story itself. He is the one the Night King wanted to kill because he is it.",8,20 May 2019,11,29

the most fitted is the hand,
we have north kingdom,
and John is where he wants

One thing is to not like it, another is to give it 1 star and hate on it mindlessly. 99% of these ""reviews"" make no mention of WHY it was so ""bad"". The ending was the best we could've hoped for for a series like this. Nobody was expecting Bran (or wanted) on the Iron Thrones, but he was the rational and logical choice for a king. Who better to rule than someone with no emotions, no impulses or agendas, who can also see everything and knows everything? Sansa got the ending she deserved. Queen of the North. Arya's ending was unexpected, but great also. She crossed the Narrow Sea back in S4, went back to Westeros, and now wants to explore more of the world. Sam got to become what he always wanted. Tyrion ended up in the best position he could've hoped for, and in the best place (some of the show's best moments were when he was in King's Landing). Dany's death was poetic and powerful, seeing her climb to the throne and then being stabbed by Jon. One of the best scenes was Brienne filling in Jaime's life in the book of the Kingsguard. And Podrick is now a knight!! I could go on, but I've made my point. The episode was amazing.",10,20 May 2019,37,123

4010,"For all of you complaining about this episode and the final season maybe you should go back and rewatch the series and pay closer attention. I mean the writing was on the wall the whole time. John never wanted the crown he was never going to accept it. Bran whether you like it or not was the best fit, him knowing the mistakes of the past is the best way to make for a better future. What did you expect from a show/books that always looked to veer away from your expectations and deliver something different. Of all the reviews that I've read about this season many gave no idea on how they thought it should go just complained like whiny children, and of the that did give another take on how it should have gone was unoriginal and a third grader could have come up with. Stop flooding Instagram and other outlets with your nonsense and enjoy the show for the great program that it is.",10,20 May 2019,51,177

4013,"I'm glad this series happened. It was a wonderful ride!
The hatred I see is fueled by both casuals and high fantasy fanbase (trolls, dragons, black hats/white hats).
It would have been better to make it a historical (without a dragon lord tyrant / zombies and magic) so as to get rid of opinionated teenage viewers and fantasy fans.
I've noticed ""Beyond the Wall"" (season 7), the worst written and plotted episode in the whole series has a score of 9.1 just because of zombies and dragons...that pretty much says everything about the fanbase the show has.
The last three episodes were great, and yet they have scores which oscillate between 5 and 6. The world doesn't deserve a series as good as this.
Next time, bring more dragons, more zombies, aliens, vampires, big explosions and cast Michael Bay as the director. Make the most moronic fanfiction ever! That's what the populace wants.",10,20 May 2019,19,57

4016,"This is the first review I have ever written. And the only reason I am doing so, is because this is simply the best show I have ever seen and I'm so sick and tired of all the bad reviews. Everyone seems so upset at how this show ended, but it's funny to me, because what exactly did you expect?? Sorry none of the outrageous theories panned out, but props to the writers for staying true to the characters and ending the show the right way.I find it entertaining that everyone is so upset with the last season but not a single mention of how they think it should have ended. Hilarious! Maybe this is the first show many of you have ever fallen in love with and seen it end. Well guess what, I hate to break it you, but all good things come to an end. And we are lucky that it didn't go for ten more years just for the sake of not ending. Watching a great show drone on and turn into complete crap is truly terrible and we're fortunate that was not the case with GOT.I think we would all be better off if we just admit that we are sad to see the show end. It hurts to be so invested in the characters and see their ultimate fate. There's no more wondering about how it will end, now we know. Maybe we take a moment and realize that it's the journey that made it so great. Endings hurt. That's why they are called endings. There's no possible way for the show to end that would make everyone happy. I thought the ending was phenomenal. I have a hunch that the vast majority of people agree, but probably won't take the time to write a positive review.All I am saying is that a show like this only comes along every so often. And yes, it hurts when it ends. But please don't take it out on the people that worked hard to make the show. All things come to an end and this show is as good as it gets. Bravo. 10/10.

Almost every ending of any show would seem disappointing, not because it's really bad but because people don't like endings, and that's true.. I think that GOT pulled out the best that they could in this episode after episode 4 and (for me, not so bad but still bad) 5. So my grade for this ending is 9.. Be realistic, there is not too much TV shows where u liked the end, this can't be less than 8..",9,20 May 2019,37,125

All you people rating this a one out of their anger is childish, this ending is what we should expect from GoT. No one is happy at the end, the guy who always did what was right got boned, his punishment was just enough to make everyone unhappy. This ending wasn't the best but it could have actually been bad like Dexter and deserve all these 1's but it wasn't nearly that bad. It was a good ending, far from perfect, I would normally rate this somewhere between a 7-8 but I'll have to give this a 10 just to hopefully outset a little bit of all these 1 that the kids are doing.

4025,"Firstly, I was thoroughly entertained by this episode. However it didn't meet my expectations as far as the story went. I think they were trying to outsmart the audience with several 'gotcha' moments, but rather than surprise us they only succeeded in pissing off a large number of loyal fans (and I'm not sure there are any other type of Game of Thrones fan!), something they've been doing all through season 8 judging by the reviews. We clearly needed at least one more season to tell the remainder of the saga or at the very least better writing. I wouldn't be surprised if in a year or so we find out the real reason the ball was dropped in season 8, but I won't even try to speculate.Any who, not the ending I wanted yet it certainly will suffice.

Our favorite characters died as a symbol that nothing is sacred and nothing is safe. This show has been the best on television for nearly a decade because the viewer doesn't know what will happen next, and we have loved it for that. But now, just because we didn't get exactly what we wanted, we revolt. We call the show creators names and wish terrible things on them for doing the same thing they have done since the beginning.

4042,"Move over Bible. The final episode of Game of Thrones is the new pinnacle of human storytelling.No but jokes aside people are drastically overreacting. This is not nearly as bad as people are saying. ""8 years of storytelling in the trash"" and ""Tommy Wiseau level of quality"" I beg you to ask yourself, how? The final season is far from perfect, but apart from a few character arc beats that were missed, it's still a pretty good narrative. All of Jaime's character development gone? He's the same character he was at the beginning? No, he is a man who realizes the truth of who he is. It's a dark, tragic arc, but it's an arc nonetheless. Daenerys going crazy makes no sense? Pay close attention to Emilia Clarke's acting throughout the show, every time she burns someone or discusses liberation. She has been repressing her true desire for power and bloodlust since the beginning. Her blind belief that she must break the wheel, that she is a saviour, is exactly what makes her the violent vengeance she becomes. This arc has been set up forever. Again, the season, and the last episode, are not perfect. I rated 10/10 as a joke, it's probably more like 6 or 7, which is still very solid. I would be willing to respect negative opinions and discuss certain criticisms, but no one is actually making any points of any sort. Every review I see is 1 star saying no more than ""wow that's a disappointment"". It's laughable.Also, just take a second to think about the thousands of people working tirelessly, hours on end, on sets, costumes, and visual effects. Now, many people working on something doesn't mean it can't be bad. BUT take those hardworking people into consideration when you sign a stupid petition saying to ""remake season 8"" just because it didn't go the way you would have wanted.

4056,"Before hating on me first read.
Everyone is blaming David and Dan . But the truth is THIS IS GEORGE's ending. He told them the ending YEARS ago. he said it himself in a fan convention that you can find on youtube. we all agree on it being a little rushed . It was only 6 episodes to have 3 villains (one turned to a villain) is a little too much unless the episode is 2 hours long. Making it a total of 12 regular episodes . Now lets discuss the characters acrs
Jon : he never wanted to be a king . He wanted to be free. He loved Ygritte because he felt free with her . Going beyond the wall with the free folk is HIS freedom. He is relieved from the burden of being in charge and he was done fighting. This is a happy ending for him.Arya : we all know she was rebellious . She used her faceless men training to kill the Night King. And she avenged her family by killing the Freys.Sansa : god i hated her at the beginning then she became one of the smartest people on GOT . She saw how the north bled from southern rulers. All what she did was to protect her family and her people.Dany : there were many hints of her fate since season 2 . Her madness was always there. Mental illness can be passed through genes too. Losing her best friend , her loyal friend , 2 of her dragons , the love of her life and her claim to the throne in a very short time can drive anyone nuts. she was abused her whole life . And an unstable person with endless power can become ruthless. She got what she deserved and broke the wheel just like she wanted.Bran : he is far from useless , because of him Jon knew who he was . Which influenced Sansa manipulating Tyrion and Varys trying to kill Dany. And driving Dany Mad. Because of him they knew the night king breeched the wall and gave them time to prepare. He can now see the future. You can see he didn't flinch when NK was going for his sword because he knew Arya was going to kill him. And to the question about why he didn't say something to stop Dany ? If you watched many time travel movies you'd know that messing with the timeline could lead to worse events.Him being a king makes sense too. He can get married . He doesn't need gold or glory . He was stripped from his emotions when he became the 3 eyed raven . He can't be manipulated by greed or power.
Cersei : her death was poetic justice . The keep was the source of her power . That power dropped all over her head and killed her.We can all agree or disagree. Some wanted to see Dany or Jon or both ruling together. but all we can agree on is GOT has a very large fan base and they can't please everyone. But don't disrespect their work because you didn't get the end you wanted.",10,23 December 2019,14,41
4057,"9.5The general consensus characterizes Season 8, and the finale in particular, with many words but I will use only one: trash. Calls for rewrites and the executions of D&D are quite popular in this IMDb review section. Extending beyond this very opinionated website, YouTubers like Jeremy Jahns and Wisecrack (who I generally agree with and respect) also weren't fans of the season and this finale. However, I have a differing opinion. I think George RR Martin, DB Weiss, and David Benioff deserve a booming round of applause for the ending they delivered. In this review, I will attempt to combat a few of the most common issues people have with Season 8 and The Iron Throne.But, before I fight differing opinions, I'd like to throw out a few of the things I enjoyed about this episode. The ash and snow that dusts King's Landing is eerie, still, and horrifying at the same time. The effects of The Bells are truly felt by the immersive production design, the pale color pallet, and the quiet sound design. The technical aspects of this episode should be commended for brewing a tone of such devastation. The directors and the cinematographer, Johnathan Freeman, create some of the most haunting and harrowing images of the entire show. Whether it is Jamie's golden hand peeking out of the rubble, Drogon inspecting Jon outside the Red Keep, or the Iron Throne melting into a furious magma-- the shot is crafted beautifully and in a manner that transmits the appropriate message (finality, intimidation, and awe respectively). Concerning the music, Ramin Djiwadi's score is one of the elite television scores of all time. His work in this episode (The Iron Throne, Last of the Starks) had me tearing up at almost every swell of music. Related to the cast, Peter Dinklage gives a performance that cements himself as one of the television greats. His tears, his anger, his hopelessness cut right into the heart. I simply do not understand how someone could watch this episode, see his performance, and then claim that the episode is deserving of a 1/10. That grade is a great disservice to Mr. Dinklage's ability to convey some of the deepest pains in television history. Similarly, Kit Harrington brings far more maturity to his role than in previous seasons. The stormy internal conflict he feels the entire episode can obviously be seen in Jon's actions; but also, and far more impressively, it can be seen in his eyes and body language. People complain that half of Jon's lines are ""She is my queen"" and ""No"" but fail to respect the nuance in his delivery between the beginning of the season and in this final episode.Here I would like to confront a few of the issues people have had with this episode. Many of these issues have in-show explanations.""Jon's claim to the throne lead to nothing."" Jon's heritage and name serve the crucially important purpose of widening the divide between himself and Daenerys. Our Breaker of Chains had been losing everything in her conquest of Westeros-- her friends, her alliances, and finally her lover. Because of his ethical code and the family tree he finds himself in, Jon is unable to commit himself to Daenerys in the manner in which she needs. Jon's distancing himself from Daenerys is a part of the steep decline of her mental state. ""Fear it is.""""Poor pacing."" With this one, I somewhat agree. I love Game of Thrones and obviously I wish we could have gotten more of it. The Iron Throne feels like two episodes, and I am of the opinion that it would have functioned better broken up. However, the poor pacing does not entirely compromise the show's integrity. Saying the show's imperfect pacing retroactively destroys the season as a whole is overreactive.""Bran is a terrible choice for King. It was a random choice made for shock value."" Bran the Broken will forever be a point of tension amongst Game of Thrones fans, and I don't think it should be. Yes, other characters have a better story; but the purpose of having a great story is only for the purpose of satisfying the common people. This 'good story' qualification is not the only determiner of Bran's kingship according to Tyrion and the show itself. George RR Martin, if he had any one thing to say in Game of Thrones it would be this: the pursuit of power corrupts. The desire for power is what creates the very conflict that is the Game of Thrones. The throne has corrupted a myriad of characters including Littlefinger, Stannis, Cersei, and finally Daenerys, the one who we rooted for since season 1. Some of the biggest heroes of the show are those who do not want the Throne (Jon, Ned, Varys, Tyrion). Someone who does not truly desire the throne/power is someone best suited for it, because he/she will not be corrupted by its draw. Bran, in his Three-Eyed-Raven omniscience, is the perfect candidate for the job. Because he does not desire it, he will be perfectly suited for it. Even he understands this. The role of the Three-Eyed-Raven is to be 1) Man's connection to the past (as Sam describes earlier in this season) and 2) to be impartial. Bran truly is the perfect King for an imperfect world. But what about Jon? you might ask if you are one of the four people reading the review. And to that I say (first, thanks for reading and) that Jon would be narratively unsatisfied by becoming King. For Jon to be truly happy, he would have to be unbound by the constraints of the political world. The smile at the beginning of his journey to rebuild beyond the wall is indicative of a truly satisfied arc and a rejuvenated sense of purpose. It is a happy ending for Jon, and I personally enjoyed it.""Evil Daenerys was out of left field."" and also ""Evil Daenerys was too heavily foreshadowed."" Newspapers, critics, and casual reviewers can't seem to make up their mind on Daenerys. Was it too obvious or was it not obvious enough? In my opinion, her arc had an unexpected, yet tragically inevitable conclusion. There is precedent set in the previous seasons that she is hellbent to fix the world in her own way, not the ways of others (Qarth, Mereen's Masters). Her death is beautiful, cathartic, and sad to its core. From the writing to the music to the cinematography to the performances-- the scene is one of the peaks of Game of Thrones.""Where is the 'Game' in Game of Thrones?"" The catastrophic burning of King's Landing is A) the culmination of all the plotting and prodding of seasons before and B) the destruction of that very 'Game'. The sole purpose of Drogon burning the Iron Throne is to say that the Game is dead. Daenerys broke the wheel. There is no purpose in having more of the 'game' once the 'game' has been metaphorically killed.""This season just tried to subvert expectations, and that's it."" Genre tropes being subverted is a trademark of Game of Thrones, has everyone forgotten that? The Red Wedding, Ned's beheading, Geoffrey's villainy instead of innocence, and so many more things put a twist on fantasy genre expectations. However, subversions of expectations are not inherently good and the event must be judged on its own merits. And, to repeat myself, these shocking moments in the finale may seem unexpected, but upon reflection, are inevitable. The ground work is laid for Bran's kingship, for Jon's betrayal of Daenerys, and for the paths each characters take._ ""Daenaerys' has way too many Unsullied and Dothraki."" Yes, this is true. I have an issue with this. However, and similar to the poor pacing complaint, this is not compromising of the show entirely. Continuity errors and little plot holes like these did happen. And sure, it did kind of bother me for a few seconds, but in no way does an issue like this leave an indelible stain on the conclusion of the show.""The series was ruined by D&D as soon as they ran out of material from GRRM."" This complaint is a curious one. I do believe that season 5 takes a dip in quality in its first few episodes as a result of breaking away from the source material. But, to say that the quality of the show is dependent upon its reliance to the source material is flat out wrong. BOTB, The Door, The Winds of Winter, and many other episodes from seasons 5, 6, 7 rank highly in the top tens amongst critics, fans, and IMDb scores. Also, those episodes and the following seasons were not solely the creations of D&D. To assume that George RR Martin does not have any creative input in the show past season 4 would be naive. Martin has also defended the ending and the showrunners, claiming it is 'silly' for fans to ask if the ending is 'real'.""Lazy writing."" This is far and away the greatest complaint of the finale. And, for some odd reason, I don't understand what it means. Thousands of reviewers claim that the episode was written poorly, without any substantial reason as to WHY it was written poorly. Many claim that it is poor writing because the Night King didn't win. For these people, I apologize that the show did not aim to fulfill your fan theory. Many claim Jon should have become King. For these people, I also apologize that the show did not fulfill your fan theory. The complaints of poor writing seem to ignore the conclusion of Tyrion's story, which is probably my favorite ending. He straightens out the chairs for the small council meeting, taking the careful time to make sure all is in order. When the council comes in, they uproot all the work he's done and push the chairs into a disorderly mess. This is fantastic writing. It expertly shows the purpose of Tyrion's character-- he will be the man without honor and without praise, but will continue to fix the world nonetheless. The small council meeting also is demonstrative of meticulously thought out writing. Westeros still has conflict, but now it has a system in place to move toward a better world.I wish I could speak more on these issues, but I have ran out of space. Game of Thrones is not perfect, but this ending deserves more credit than it is getting.",10,13 June 2019,14,41

What is that? I don't mind that bran is the king of the six kingdoms (I don't agree but it's okay), but I really dislike his nickname, why? All Kings have nicknames but they weren't called that way when they reigned. I felt like if Tyrion was called Tyrion the dwarf.

It's a good ending and didn't pander to the hopes and expectations of weak-minded viewers. They told a story that is richer than ""Dany ruled with a just and benevolent hand"", and they told it pretty damn well. My only complaint in season 8 is that the battle of Winterfell could have been longer, but that's okay. LOL at all the traumatised viewers who can't handle a fictional tragedy, what would happen if they went to see Shakespeare? Would they complain about the writing?

GOT has been one of my favourite series for years and now the only thing left is disappointment, not because I wanted it to end differently but because the writers disrespected their fanbase.
A superb plot was what made GOT different from the other fantasy shows and nothing of that is left in this finale.
Is there anything good? Yes, good visual effects and some scenes were fairly directed but these factors have a very little weight if compared to the writing which is the thing I personally care more when I'm watching a TV show or a movie.
This final episode definitely didn't have a good writing, this is probably one of the worst episodes of the entire series and this is unacceptable for a finale.

This was poorly thrown together slapdash with many unanswered questions, one of which is listed below.-Jon saved the entire realm from a mad queen tyrant in the making. First of all, why would the people of the Queen's army not kill him for murdering the Queen. Secondly, his punishment for saving millions of innocents deaths for future 'liberations' was being banished to the Knights Watch (no longer has a purpose with a huge hole in the wall and no enemies to stop) to appease the Army of the Unsullied who then left WesterosAs a long term fan, having devoted so many hours to watching the show and endured the long waits between season releases, one becomes emotional attached to the story line.

4132,"Ending was very bittersweet just as the writer said. I loved every moment of it. Only thing making it better would have been three more episodes . Or season nine. But thats just a fanboy speaking. I hate it to end but good things needs to end at some point. I respect the creators work on this and in my opinion people should respect it too. Its their view of the books and i consider myself lucky to be part of it as a viewer. Very well done and i cant wait to see what will become next. On this fantastic world of martins books or anything other you, the creators, might do next. Once again. Very well done!",10,20 May 2019,18,56
4133,Bran Stark was the villain all along. Watch the episode again and his remarks about Iron throne and Drogon. He told Jon he was where he wanted. He was all along playing for the throne and the biggest player no one ever imagined was the cripple. His only obstacle was the Night King.,10,20 May 2019,18,56
4134,"This season felt so rushed. The war with the Night King and the war with Cersei could have easily been separated into two seasons. It would have allowed the story to go more in depth.
More to the relationships with each other (Jon and Dany, Jaime and Brienne, Dany and Sansa, Sansa and Theon, night king and Bran etc.). We did not get enough of the relationships between characters to fully understand their connections (good or bad) to each other.
More character development. More cause for a ""Mad Queen"" if that's what the writers had intended all along. More to explain why they acted the way they did. More to explain their ending. Doing it this way makes it seem like a copout. Its like they were done playing the game of thrones and wanted to move on.
I understand creating a show is not easy. The acting was amazing especially with what writing they were given. The special effects were great. I applaud the cast and crew.",3,26 January 2020,6,14
4135,"If I was making a review on the writing this would be a one. The first 2 episodes of season 8 were lovely, however ever since the night king died so quickly it's become way too fast and some things make no sense. Nobody wanted Dany to become a villain. Bran didn't deserve the throne, but I'm not completely mad over that. Bran will make a great king. Dany and Jon should've had a happy ending. Jon should've been the king. But this episode got crapped over by episodes 4 and 5. However, the costumes, CGI, visuals, acting, cinematography, and music are perfect. Every shot is stunning.In conclusion, the acting and effects are perfect. The writing is awful.",5,5 June 2019,6,14

4141,"This episode continues the trend of this season of each episode being worse than the previous. This is just a mere caricature of what it used to be. With all logic thrown out of the window.Tyrion finding Jaimes golden hand and digging him and Cersei up is just pure Hollywood kitsch. The Dothraki keep magically incrasing (again). Dany giving her speech to the soldiers is a uncreative rehash of (insert every movie depicting a Hitler-like leader giving a speech to a crowd ever). Drogon seems to be able to smell Dany's passing and destroys the Iron throne after. Apparently the dragon has a thing for corny symbolism as well. Same goes for the weather (whats with the sudden snowstorm that disappeared as quickly as it came?). Tyrion's plot armour is still in full effect even after betraying Dany twice. Then there's more corniness with Brienne writing about Jaime and ""The Son of Ice and Fire"" book.Pair that with a loop of different kinda of cliché sad music and you got a disappointing finale.",1,21 May 2019,6,14
4142,"Kinda spoilers...but not really...This is a quick summary of the entire episode:So, a person walks, pensively and slowly. Then another person walks pensively and slowly. Then another person does it too. Then there's pensive talking, one big scene with fire and melting, then some pensive walking. Then some talking - Bran's there...he can't pensively walk...slowly or otherwise, 'cause, you know - wheelchair and all. Then there's some talking. Then a decision based on some pensive talking, which overall comes out the blue and makes no sense whatsoever. Then some pensive getting ready, more pensive walking. Finally, it ends with pensive sitting down wearing a crown, pensive boat walking, and some more pensive walking...but there are horses too.That must have been some mighty fine direction....""Okay, *insert actor's name here*, walk more slowly and pensively. There! Perfect!""If you cut out all the walking, the episode would have been 30 minutes long. You could fast forward through it until speaking scenes and absolutely not miss a thing.",1,21 May 2019,6,14
4143,"I admit this season feels rushed at times, which is a shame. The season should have been at least two episodes longer. But I still feel the show and final season deserves more credit. It is not justifiable how low ratings some people give the finale and most of the episodes. I loved the finale. I think the characters were ended perfectly. Everyone is entitled to their opinions but stop giving it 1 of 10, that is just stupid. The show has been perfect in so many aspects, so stop hating so much because of some flaws and some rushed moments. The show is simply epic and I simply hate to see such amounts of hate for so little to the best tv ever.",10,20 May 2019,6,14

I can't believe Game of Thrones is over, it's been a huge part of my life for the past eight years and it's so sad to see it end, but I guess all good things must come to an end, right? I'm looking for the prequels and of course, the real ending of the story from George R.R. Martin. What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger. Long live A Song of Ice and Fire!",10,20 May 2019,15,45
4147,"Just think about it. We spent 8 seasons to see who is going to be the ruler of Westeros, calculating and predicting every episode, just to end up with odds for and against Dany and Jon. Baratheons, Starks, Lannisters, Targareyens - all of them tried to become the one and only, fighting against each other, plotting for their cause.Now, when all this ends, we can say one thing. Blood can only make more blood. Yes, it is unfortunately something we didn't want to believe or hear, but every battle, every death were only overcome by other.Until this day.Today, in this very last episode, the justice was finally given. Those who had death written on their bodies, died, those who had wanted justice, earned justice. This all is behind us, because this words are only connected to old world - world of ice and fire. We no longer need justice, no longer seek death of others.Bran becomes the king.The choice not many believed in, Bran the Broken showed us he was someone truly intelligent. He could whisper and spy, he could see and fly and finally, he could see the past. But now he needs to rule The Westeros to the future.This episode ended the biggest parade of the modern world and all of us had the opportunity to live with it. Now, when the last ring belled, last book was closed and last queen of the seven kingdoms is no more, we have to say that we enjoyed it.Bran as the king is starting the new part of westeros. Part in which democracy is starting to be useful. We would like to live in this world, if we could. We could be the ones who speak about great battles, unbelievable deaths and at the same time live in peace and prosperity (with a lot of brothels). This is the world everyone wanted to see, but we didn't want to say it, because we were bloodthirsty.But now, we can. And what is more important, we should.",10,20 May 2019,44,159

I implore everyone who loved Game of Thrones to go watch Attack on Titan because you will not be let down. The story, music, animation, world building, stakes, character development and overall EPICNESS is second to none.

4157,"As entire season, even this episode was speed up. Characters behave out of character, some important decisions are made just based on few words. Sickly loyal Jon Snow decides to kill his queen just after a short conversation with Tyrion, despite the fact that dozen other characters were convincing him the same, or similar thing for the entire season. Dragon suddenly has mental capacities to understand allegorical meaning of the iron throne.Unsullied who were executing everyone disloyal to their new queen, decide to imprison Jon Snow after killing their queen. And in the end, council that has to choose a new king believes in words said by the man in whose words everyone have a right to doubt. Tyrion, even imprisoned convinced lords of Westeros to choose Bran as a king, because he has ""a good story"". New way of choosing a king is supposed to ""break a wheal"" as Deni said, but no one says what will happen if someone, in the future, for some reason, decides not to obey to the council and proclaims him-self as a king? Or if any other kingdom decides to abandon 6 kingdoms, as North did. Game of thrones starts again. Jon's heritage doesn't have any meaning at this point, except that Tyrion used it as a reason for Deni to have him killed, as he represents a threat to her. Bran, three-eyed raven, that can see past and future, needs master of whisperers.Full of flaws and unanswered questions, unrecognizable characters, illogical decisions made in 10 minutes that ruin 7 season long character building.

4175,"Final Season 8 was unsatisfying & rushed.Jon Snow
Jon Snow was practically reduced to a Hodor-like mentality who was only able to utter, ""she's my queen....she's my queen."" When discussing Dani's madness with Tyrion. Jon was almost a blithering idiot. He wasn't even a competent military leader in the battle at King's landing and was slow to issue orders or control his army. I expected more from Jon Snow/Aegon Targaryen.Night King
The Night King was too easy to kill. Sure He could withstand dragon fire big deal, but you'd think there would still be more to such a legendary evil. The choice of Arya seemed all wrong. Arya is a top notch killer, but the producers' choice still seemed to be to please the current girl power theme in Today's tv-films. The Lord of Light brought back. Beric Dondarion & Jon Snow for a purpose. Shouldn't they been the ones to destroy the Night King? Having Arya do the deed made their resurrections seem superfluous.Jamie Lannister
Having Jamie returning his obsessed love for Cersei was definitely a disappointment. He seemed to mature into a healthier person only to regress back to a selfish hateful person was upsetting.Cersei
I think she deserved to die by Jaime's hand or via Arya instead of a romantic death.Samwell Tarly
I was disappointed that the screenplay forced the s tor who played Samwell Tarly to fight as an utter coward. In a previous battle, Samwell was scared but was brave.Tyrion
I am very happy that Tyrion survived the story. He was my favorite character.Bran Stark
I was disappointed that he was not given an opportunity to warg into one of the dragons. Not essential, but I was expecting him to exhibit his super warging talents. On the other hand, I think Bran will make a wise King.Overall I think there should have been more episodes & possibly an additional season to adequately tell the Song of Ice & Fire.",7,28 May 2019,9,24

The snow falls across the city of death as you hear cries of Tyrion crying for the remains of his house.

A dragon tyrant has awoken...The best parts of this episode is not in the words or writing but in the imagery.

Sansa got what she wanted bymaking the north a free kingdom where they will never bend a knee for anyone else

4195,"This was an amazing ending for an amazing series. I can understand some people are angry and feeling cheated because it's not the ending they wanted. But to these, I would say: go back and binge watch the whole series again, for every characters' arc came down to its natural end.Dany's demise into madness could have been foreseen since the earliest development of her character. We've all been fooled, like Tyrion and Jorah, because we wanted to believe in her, not because she was the perfect ruler (and because Emilia Clark was so adorable in her role).Arya never was a killer or an assassin, but always an adventurer with vengeance on her mind. Vengeance fulfilled, what's left is adventure...Bran becoming the king of the six kingdoms is the most logical ending to break the wheel of the game of thrones. It's not because he didn't have to fight for the throne that Westeros doesn't deserve him as the rightful ruler.As for Jon, he never wanted to rule, but he's destined to, in certain ways. He's off with the wildlings, now the King from Beyond the Wall. It's where he belongs. He's at home there, and will hopefully live an happy life with Ghost. We can imagine him meeting another Igrid, and that's really great for him.I think it's a bit sad that the final season was rushed to its conclusion, even though the conclusion is absolutely the right one. But things must come to an end, and this one satisfies me 100%. It is very sad that people's reaction and frustration are ruining the work of the cast and crew. To the fans that think they deserved better from the series, I would say this: the series deserved better from its fans. Shame.",10,20 May 2019,12,35

4200,"The first 4 seasons were compelling and complex. It wobbled by season 5 & 6. It's like the writers became afraid and decided to go back to trite tropes. And then recognised what they were doing and thought that an idea out of left field (Brann...really???....really???) would distract the viewers enough to then be able to sweep everything under the carpet.I liked the flawed characters. I enjoyed the divided loyalties - that's what you'd expect from having that many reigning houses. I even went along with the mysticism, it made it more than just a knight in shining armour tale. But there were too many dead ends, too many detours that just didn't make sense. Just what role did the Red Woman really play in all of this? Other than bringing Jon Snow back to life. But then again, what purpose did that little part of the plat play anyway? It's not as if his having been dead was 'worth' anything in terms of plot later on anyway.There were lots of these strands that felt as if the writers were just tired of trying to keep things going and in their place, so they decided to just let them fritter away.Much like Jon's whole future existence, really. His expression at the end sort of said it all. ""Oh well, guess I better plod along"".",2,28 June 2019,2,3

There was almost no way for the producers to do it 'right'. I urge everyone to rewacht S8 and then come up with a review and not repeat what everyone says.
The only fair critique is that the pace was to high. If this would be spread out in a few more longer episodes, it would be better. But in the end, the end makes sense. It's maybe not what you wanted or expected, but I wanted some people in earlier season not to die as well. I got used to it. Just accept the facts and watch it over a few times, this takes some time to digest. And this episode does have beautiful moments.

4204,"Was I happy witht eh ending - no, of course not. Why? Because the whole thing was so rushed.. You cannot just simply wrap up such a huge storyline in 6 short episodes (where basically two of them were just 50 minute long fighting scenes, so much airtime wasted). We have never watched GoT because of animation of hour long fighting scenes, it has been and was always about the story and characters. The last episode was as best as it could have been made, because they basically butchered the show already in season 7. If they wanted to make a decent ending, they should have made 2 or 3 more season to really wrap things up.. To be honest, i was relieved it was over, unfortunately, I didn't really care what happened to any of them and that is a shame..",2,21 May 2019,2,3
4205,"A rushed finish in what felt like a rushed season all round.
It's hard to imagine how such a wonderfully written show ended up with writing that would more likely be seen in a b-grade series.You could see that at times even the actors struggled to convey the script when there was so little sense in what was happening.Nevertheless, there were a few (and only a few) nice moments, which carried the episode along.In all, it has been a disappointing finale to what could have been one of the best productions of all time.",2,21 May 2019,2,3

And the people just accept their independency like it was nothing?.
Continuing with Dany, you didn't even let her sit on the iron throne, at least if you wanted to kill her properly, would have been better that she ruled for a while, like 6 months? and then go with what you planned, but what you did seem so rushed, like the NK death, all the build up for a ninja and saiyan arya (She just teletransported and the unsullied and dothrakis???) killed him right away!!Very dissapointing.",1,21 May 2019,2,3

4209,"Even from the first episode of season 8 there were some notable mistakes in writing. But I ignored it thinking they'll give us a kick-ass final episode like they did with season 6. But no, the finale of the greatest tv series I've ever watched ended up a big disappointment. I'm not saying this because I've read many GoT theoris and fanfiction, so I wanted the story to finish in a Disney fairytale ending, where Jon and Daenerys fly into the sunset on their dragons after becoming King and Queen of seven kingdoms. No I wanted GoT to end in a bittersweet way that is deserving for both the source material and fans. I don't care if they'd killed Jon, Dany and all of Stark family. But there should be build up for that. Cersei should have been killed in a more fitting way, Jaime's character development shouldn't have been thrown out of the window, Jon's Targaryen lineage should have become a topic of debate at the final council to select a ruler, Jon's leadership qualities should have been given more prominance, what happened to the Prince that was promised prophecy?",2,21 May 2019,2,3
4210,"It wasn't disappointing as much as it was boring to watch a bunch of random events unfolding in the last 90 minutes or so. Everything felt so rushed. Imagine the buildup after all those seasons just to end in the worst possible way just because someone decided it has to end. The lowest point in this episode was choosing a Stark as king of the 7 kingdoms and suddenly Sansa, another Stark, declaring independence. Nobody else even blinked an eye. That makes even less sense than the dragon burning the iron throne for whatever reason. Consider the history of those houses and all their conflicts and imagine them choosing a king in like 5 minutes. Unsullied and dothraki apparently have no voice or interest in politics since their queen got murdered but none showed up and demand proper justice. Exile to the wall was hardly justice. Remind us why is there night watch after there is nothing up there again? Jon Snow was the most pathetic character in the whole 8 season. He did nothing but whining and he got exactly what he deserved in the end.

4223,"Think about it: the hero who went through hell to save the innocent and support a new regime ends up realising this new ruler is a tyrant and it's his job to stop them, kills the ruler they believed in, and is sent away to start a new life!
What makes GoT unique is how details accumulate to explain character development, and how the storyline makes sense even if it's not ""happy"". In the last season the writers thought they are making sense but they weren't, there were no details to support the development of the story and so it just had gaps and seemed disjointed. Even the timeline doesn't make sense!
My analysis is this: the writers had to follow the general outline set by the future books without giving too much details, so the role of Bran is vague, this would be clarified in the books where we will understand that he was manipulating people and events so he can rule, the reason for that relates to other details the show didn't include.
I'm disappointed with the season because it ruined an amazing show, it was not true to the fans, it was rushed and written in a juvenile way.
I hope the books will be available soon so we could follow the progress of the story, it will have the same ending but it will make sense when we have more information. But for this season I would rate it as 0 if that was possible",1,20 May 2019,2,3

4228,"I have written reviews for the last 3 episodes of this season and am really really trying to review each episode separately. There are some points to mention:
1. It hurts so much watching a great show go down like this. I was laughing during the whole episode. How many times did you guys copy pasted ""She is the queen"" lines for these actors?
2. Jon saying ""She didn't have a choice"" when I can name 100 other scenarios with an outcome better than this.
3. Thanks for giving Jon the Azor Ahai moment, I would have felt much more satisfied if his character was not like a Zombie, and AGAIN you used the switch mechanism for Jon too. That's lazy writing, you suddenly go from ""She is my queen"" to ""just let's kill her and stay there although there is no evidence until they catch me. Best killer ever, 100 points for Jon for being a stupid Azor Ahai.
4. So Jon killed the queen and Unsullied just said ok let's imprison him to what end???? It's not like they follow any rules.
5. Tyrion plot armor +200 just to keep the fans satisfied.
6. Remind me again why Tyrion is still alive?
7. So Bran is the king now? oh god... just the minute you think it can't get worst
8. Bran wanting to navigate Drogon... Nope just nope for so many reasons
9. Someone explain to me why Jon is not the king after Danny is dead? You may say he betrayed her but if you give it 2 min of thought you see that she betrayed him and deserved to die because Jon was the rightful heir.
10. why Jon is in the prison? Last time I checked Arya is a faceless man, She could have broke him out anytime she wanted.
11. The jokes in this episode were not funny and out of place, but I guess the biggest joke was the episode.
12. Thanks D&D. You should be banned from writing. find new jobs that you have talents in.",1,20 May 2019,2,3

The writers (who also directed this joke of a last epsiode) can rest in shame knowing they buried the best saga ever told in a series.

He could just be the king. Are they just afraid of Grey Worm and the Unsullied army?? Sansa said that the Northern Army is in the Capital and she threatens with it.Ok. I get it that the utophia where Jon and Dany takes the throne have children and rule the world together is impossible anymore since Dany has lost her mind and determined to make people bend the knee from Dorne to Winterfell and it means that there would be more burned people and she would have to get killed somehow but it doesn't feel right!Anyway in the end everybody seems happy.

To start with the endings with the main cast, some hit for me others didn't. I was quite satisfied with a lot of minor characters endings such as Davis becoming master of ships or even Bronn becomingmaster of coin (despite not understanding how banks work). Some main characters endings also worked for me such as Sansa becoming queen in the North or Jon becoming lord commander of the nights watch (but it seemed he was more de facto king beyond the wall). Brans ending made me mad though. Like really mad. How can someone without compassion become the person to look after an entire kingdom?My biggest problem with the ending is... What did any of the build up and foreshadowing add up to? Like really. What is the point of Jon's heritage. What was the point of the nightking but be killed in one episode. What wa sthe point if two seasons of Arya training to be a faceless assassin (and the why is she even alive still). Im so annoyed to think of all the missed opportunities that DnD just simply ignored. Also still mad at butchering Jaime's character development.Long story short I think the issue with the past two seasons could of all been improved with more episodes, possibly even another season, and to have hired other,more competent, writers to babysit DnD while they ignore 8 seasons of build up.

4279,"For the first time in weeks, I have to say I enjoyed the first 20/25 minutes or so. This is mainly (if not entirely) thanks to Peter Dinklage's performance. Absolutely brilliant.Despite him being that good and the visuals being stunning, that doesn't distract from the broken mess this last season is. It's terrible, absolutely terrible. The thing is: I can't really point out the specific things wrong with this particular episode, simply because this was now the only possible way to go out for the show. There was no other way possible, and they executed this mess as best as it could have been. The total brokenness that was created the other 5 episodes is where the blame has to go. That's where they ruined the ending, not by the execution of which they handled it in this last episode.The absolutely ridiculous turn of Dany which now holds her in some sort of illogical delusion. The absolute slaughter of episode 3 - by which I don't mean the actual battle (no one really died anyway, looking at the size of her army today), but the slaughter of the White Walkers and Night King's storyline. Making Bran and his storyline completely useless, it was for nothing - only for him to become king. It's so, so poor and lazy - but again, the season is it fault for that, not this episode on it's own.That's why I'm giving it a 4. The season get's a 1 (one point being for effort of everyone else and the writers). Absolute disaster. This specific episode on it's own however didn't do an awful lot wrong in the execution of the already set up mess of a story. I loved Game of Thrones, yet I didn't feel anything but anger as it ended. Everything was for nothing and instead of being hurt (or feeling anything else) by the ending of the characters, this is all I'm left with.""Goodbye old friend"", just like Varyss said to Tyrion before his ridiculously destroyed story came to an end. Now, just like what happened to him, it is time to burn the show and grieve over what's left. I'm heartbroken, but for all the wrong reasons.",4,20 May 2019,2,3

who are they to judge JON? he killed Danny who slaughtered and burned the city. punishing him (the most important character) meant they admitted her as a queen.... and Drogon!!! he burned the throne and did nothing to Jon although he killed Danny!! WHAT AN AWFUL dramatic SCRIPT
This episode' events should have been on at least THREE episodes with GEORGE MARTIN 's script.
I am absolutely sure that if D&D wrote the script for Lord of the rings it would have been a one part not three and the ending is Frodo flying on the eagle to Mordor with a Starbucks coffee in his hand and throw the ring in the fire and it's over.",1,20 May 2019,2,3

The entirety of the season has been about shock value instead of things that make sense story wise. So many plot points thrown by the wayside so many "" prophecies"" gone but they kept Daenys house of the undying vision? Why? What made that one so much more special than azor or the valonqar prophecy? We had an entire season dedicated to Daenys ability to not have children and how what not only to have nothing happen with that, we Learn of Jon's true parents in season 6 only to have it go nowhere at all. All the buildup all of the story lines that lead us to this point we're abandoned in favor of ""how can we shock our fans the most, I know have Arya kill the NK, have Jon kill Daeny, have Jon be sent back to the wall (which is pointless due to no more walkers and the wildlings being cool now), have Bran be king a man that doesn't feel doesn't care and has been the most useless character in the show for this last season. HBO really disrespected the fans by allowing this mess to be shot, edited and released knowing full well Dan and Dave only gave us this nonsense so they can run off to work on their Star Wars project. It's an absolute slap in the face of the fans and the people that supported this series from day one. Even the actors hated this season and that's more telling than anything else. I pray HBO does something about this, issue a statement about how much of a mistake it was to let Dan and Dave do this to the franchise, reboot season 8, do something for the fans because those 2 assclowns clearly didn't care for the fans this season. Re-do season 8 give us 2 more seasons to flush out the story and give GRRM as much money as he wants to pen it.",1,20 May 2019,2,3
4296,"First review here but I had to make an account for this. I'm not upset at all about how the ending is not what we expected or not a happy ending for some of our favorite characters (Dany and Jon). The unpredictability was one of my favorite aspects of the show. This ending was not just a surprise though, it was plain lazy writing. They tried to shock us with the events but really just shocked us with how poorly the story unfolded. Nothing made sense, so many plot holes. So the only people who wanted Jon dead left the city but Jon still had to go North?! Why would all the other kingdoms be ok with the North being independent, wouldn't they all want their independence as well? Not just lazy, inconsistent writing, but also so cheesy. Dany's death scene was such a joke, didn't even seem like got anymore. So predictable and just laughable. I mean what did I just watch?! Bronn as master of coin? He didn't even know what loans were. Such a cheesy, terrible ending to a great show. Wish I had not watched this episode. Hope GRRM gives us a better ending. D&D ruined got. Yes the first 7 seasons were great, but this last season was a slap in the face of all fans who have been watching all seasons for years. Got deserved better, the fans deserved better. Seemed like they spent less than 5 minutes writing that garbage.",1,20 May 2019,2,3
4297,"I've been one of the few who have enjoyed this season cause I feel like it's been as good (or as bad) as it has been since season 5 ended and they moved on from the books. It seems to me that over the longer-than-usual two year break that people have forgotten that the last couple seasons of GoT only really felt good cause they were epic and not cause of any really amazing writing (but it seems clear that people have started to realise this over the last month that season 8 has been here). All this aside, that episode was weird and rushed and I think that there was potential to bring together the 'season of loose ends' that many seemed to interpret season 8 to be..",5,20 May 2019,2,3
4298,"Let's all agree that this season is so bad, that every one hopping it's a bad dream.
Every character developing in the first 7 season, every story build up, every event, every possibility, ever thing was trashed was ignored by this 6 episode season.HBO did give unlimited support for the show, and you give us only 6 episode after 2 years of waiting, and we were ok, because we thought we will have 6 long great episode like before, a story with interesting characters, events and story that are linked in a way no other show can provide.But HELL NO, let's give key characters silly (at best) deaths, except sir Jorah Mormont. let's end the show without given purpose for the white walker, why they exist what's their goal, why attack now, why if he can control dead animals (bear, horses, dragon) why his armies have no other animals. Let's kill him in in the EP 03. Why is there a three eyed Raven, how he come to be.Let's end this with a really bad joke, make Bran a king when he played nothing or a decoy in this season or with no build what so ever, it will make no difference if you make Sam the king.How can I accept the Dothraki leave Westeros without avenging their Khaleesie, when thier history is well known for savagery, vengeance and massacres, now they do what they are told and leave Westeros like that.No purpose in the end for Arya, build her up just to kill the night king like that, and every....",1,20 May 2019,2,3

But they massively screwed it up! Can not explain why they reduced Tyrion, Daenerys, Cersei, Arya and almost everyone else to a one dimensional mess. Jon and his legacy meant nothing! Years of buildup only to rush into a parodical conclusion. For me who has stuck with this story for 20 years now thanks to GRRM's writing can only hope that he has the courage to write an alternate ending and saved decades of literary work from being lost forever!RIP Game of Thrones

Because he is, he just, lacks feeling for the common humanity over which he is supposed to rule.He also can't have children so that will make realm really stable. Those lords accepting Bran the Broken and Sansa taking half the kingdom, Bronn taking the Highgarden, randoms on council is truly laughable. Edmure would be better if he never appeared.Daenerys becoming Hitler, Drogon burning the throne just because, all the scenes dragging out, Arya the explora, Sansa ""smartest"" person Arya knows (since her company is d&d and show characters it isn't much surprise).Grey worm saying ""we are sailing to Naath"" land of killer butterflies, made me roll on the floor laughing.I could berate it much more but all in all this show turned out to be huge disappointment, and as whole I give this last seasons and this episode rating of 1, I would give it -100 if possible.If the story in the books is half similar , Martin just shouldn't bother, better focus on Wildcards, Dunk and Egg or F&B 2.",1,20 May 2019,2,3

4317,Making Bran the king was purely done to subvert expectations. Having a surprising ending does not make the end a good one. It has been established that Bran didn't want to be a lord and he even claimed he could not be. But instead of sticking to the already established past the screenwriters decided to surprise the audience instead of providing them with a believable ending. I also have a problem with how Bran claimed to have known that Tyrion wanted to be King in game of thrones it was established that Bran could see the past and work into creatures but it was never established that he could see the future or be able to read minds so how could Bran have possibly known that he would be king. It also makes no sense for the north to become independent when there is a Stark on the throne meaning that the writers added that at the end not for story purposes but to give a happy ending to Sansa. My last issue with the finale is the Wildlings returning to the land of always winter because it had been established that they wanted to go south of the wall to run from white walkers and to avoid the cold. It makes no sense that they would return North after finally being able to move south I understand that they are Northerners but on multiple occasions they have mentioned avoiding the cold.,1,20 May 2019,2,3

Like is this friends? What? Literally all the tension was gone, everything was laughable and not because it was funny, but because it was ridiculous.

This may be the ending GRRM has planned (I hope we get something different and better in the books), however the rushedness in how they have brought the show to a close just makes it impossible for a lot of the major plot points to make sense.This show will forever be a game changer for entertainment and I'm not sure anything like it will ever come again.

4351,"They have murdered the only good thing I had in my life. It had such potential to be the best tv show ever created, only to be murdered in the last season. Greedy producers putting their best interests in front of creating good content, I hope they stub their toes and their star wars movies and awful (no doubt). Back to being a cog in the machine since I have nothing to look forward to anymore. Thanks D&D.",1,20 May 2019,2,3
4352,"I wanted to write just something simple, maybe joke, considering they just pulled biggest joke on us.But lets start with review.That was not Jon, that was not Greyworm, that was not Dany, that was not Drogon, that was not Game of Thrones I watched for 10 years...What was point of anything before season 8?What was the point?Everything looks pointless now. Not just pointless but meaningless.Worst episode, worst finale in worst season of show that was for me best show ever before season 8.I'm sad, you know when you are sad when your favorite character dies, or your show ends, well I'm not sad like that, I'm sad thateverything is ruined, they didn't kill my characters, they first ruined them, they didn't just end the show, they ruined it, evengood episodes now are pointless when I know they lead towards this, rewatching is impossible.Almost all actors had to act something out of their character because of lazy, rushed writing that started from E3.From this episode, let's go with something simple.Jon, ""HONORABLE FOOL"", Man who is always true to his word, who can't lie, ""not even a little bit"" if we remember Dragon Pit episodein S7, always does a right thing, and it is just like Ned to point that his honor could be death of him.Now you want me to be okay how that guy, JON, he now TRICKS the women he loves so he can get near her and stab her, did they mixedhim with someone else, because that is not Jon way of doing things. They ruined Jon too on end, if he would be against Dany, he would go like Ned did against Lanisters, face to face with Cersei and Joffrey, not with sneaky stab...
(so just like in E5 and this episode Dany was not Dany), same goes with everyone else in this episode.Greyworm, like they killed his QUEEN!? And he does nothing!? Lets another prisnoer of his Queen talk to others so they choose King...this is joke, and if I go talking to others this review would be too big for imdb to handle.Even a dragon, Drogon, they somehow managed to make CGI do something out of character. HOW?!In what world Drogon does nothing to Jon and everyone around after his mother is killed???Drogon we know would go on rampage and he would rain terror to all 7 kingdoms until someone kills him somehow, nothing makes sense.Also nights watch? Really? Did they forgot that nights watch has no purpose anymore, all they can do now is to literally watch the night. This episode and season was simply LAZY, RUSHED, and written WITHOUT ANY FEELINGS JUST SO THEY GET DONE WITH THE SHOW and move on...this felk like parody outside from starting scenes that felt like tragedy, rushed tragedy.I wish I could erase this episode, this season from memory and existence, if it never happened, I would be happy now...Please HBO, give us alternate version of S08 and maybe go for more seasons if you can with just new writers. Yeah, I know...not gonna happen...
Just on end, I want to be very clear, this rating and criticism is going only towards writting and decision to rush this show, to go for 6 episodes, 1 season, to end something that in my opinion was not that close to the end, at least not in a way that would satisy viewers and feel good.Music, effects, camera, and acting, acting was one of the best acting I ever watched, actors and actresses are the real MVP of this show, almost all actors and actresses were perfect for roles they were given, it was like they were truly them, like they lived these characters, people are wondering if in like 10-20 years we will get new version of GoT, we might, but if we do, biggest problem for new version of GoT is not be writing, or effects and budget, it will be finding someone who will fit role of these characters and be able to act and bring life to characters like cast crew of this show did, for example, how could anyone give us better Cersei than Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke was perfect Dany, Kit was perfect for Jon (not his fault he got no lines in S08)...and so on, who would be able to do this better, I don't see it.So on end I just want them to thank for years for entertainment, it feels weird, doing this while giving bad score, if I was reviewing them it would 10/10 but sadly I'm not, it is episode review and I didn't like what writers did and I explained above whyJust my feelings, hard to really express them in review.",1,20 May 2019,2,3
4353,"Forget the naysayers. This was a masterful end to a fantastic series. The story reached a beautifully emotional conclusion. The end makes perfect sense and is well fitting in with the story arc and the hints already placed within. There is a sense of closure about the episode, but what else could one expect. There is some wriggle room for spin-offs. But If you have followed the series then you already know that everything is in its rightful place. Simple things that make great viewing - Drogon carrying off Danny, John's dire-wolf greeting him at Castle Black - garner the series with a sense of fulfilment that perfectly offsets all the death that had preceded it. Brilliant, has there been anything better made for television",10,20 May 2019,16,50
4354,"Fantastic final episode. Yes, the season has been a bit rushed.. but this ending was marvelous. I have never understood the hype around Dany, she has seemed to me like a terrible contender for the throne from the start. Power hungry and self-righteous, everything you dont want in the most powerful position is Westeros. Jon is where he truly belongs, up north (the real north). Bran is truly the best choice, the ideal king. Heraditary monarchies are a terrible thing, both in the real world and in Westeros.. as we have seen *cough* Joffrey *cough*. Having a king who can not be touched by curruption, who knows and sees all, he will also only use that power for the benefit of all. He is what Dany thought she was. Like Tyrion points out. And Ghost finally got that petting, the best of boys.Just wanted to give this 10 to counter all the 1's. I appreciate it as it is. I think history will do the same, now that the hype is over.",10,20 May 2019,16,50

I had never thought it possible that anyone could write such a stupid ending to anything. I do not want to repeat all the plot holes, the inconsistencies in character development, etc., that have already been listed in this forum. There is no need to mention all the different story lines that had been developed over the last seven years that now, after the end, do not make any sense at all.

4362,"Why almost nothing made sense in the last episode? Sansa as queen of the North? It was a joke! Bran as the king without a throne and without an army? Another joke. Bran never could be the King. He is a young guy with no experience at all. He has no experience in leadership, in wars, in alliances. He never studied. He has never been able to establish bonds of friendship with anyone. He would be a weak and useless king. His first decision proved his stupidity by allowing his sister to declare herself independent. This is the first step to ending the alliance between the seven kingdoms. Daenerys, Jon, Davos, Arya and even Cersei would have been a much better rulers. So why did they do it? Probably a desire of the directors to thwart the fans and subscribes of HBO. A Demonstration of their Power. We have seen this throughout all the history: The success leads to self-confidence. Self-confidence can lead to arrogance and Arrogance leads to failure. They succeeded, they failed.

In reality, it's just an unfinished, rushed homework written by two lazy students whose only goal was getting over this project as fast as possible.I know, giving 1 star out of 10 doesn't change anything about the final season, but - if I want to be honest - it gives me more relief than a thousand lying wh@res...",1,21 May 2019,1,1

4366,"I'm gunna make this straight to the point because so many other reviewers have already gone into so much detail, all of which I agree with.This season in general has been lacklustre in writing and pacing compared to the previous seasons. Every storyline that was established in the past is no longer as relevant as it should be. D&D should have passed the torch to deserving showrunners instead of just deciding to abandon the show for Star Wars. The petition was right. I don't expect them to remake the final season but that just shows how many fans are not happy. One million may have signed, but I guarantee there is 10x more people who hated this season. Again, it's not about what happened, but rather HOW it happened. It was all rushed. I would have made season 8 all about the Night King; 9 about the war with Cersei; and 10 with Mad Queen Dany. Instead, it's all been done in 6 episodes and ended with a cliched ending that does not scream Game of Thrones. Some of the stars say the petition was disappointing and disrespectful? I would have to say the same thing to what D&D have done to the fans. The final season has brought the show's overall quality down from a 9/10 to a 6/10, and that's being generous.We are the people who made Game of Thrones mainstream and put this show on the map and the writers have betrayed us just so they can move on to bigger things. SHAME on you. I, along with many other fans, would not want to rewatch the series knowing how it went down. So congratulations guys, you trolled us and got your money. And don't even get me started on your pathetic argument about fans needing to ""subvert their expectations"".However, I would still like to thank the cast, crew, seasons 1-7 D&D, and GRRM for bringing this show into our lives. The directing, acting, special FX and cinematography throughout all 8 seasons has been amazing. But that final season broke majority of the fans' hearts and not in a good way. I will never look at this show the same way again.",3,21 May 2019,1,1

4375,"The beginning of the last episode was alright, I guess. But after the awkward kiss between Jon and Dany, I cringed and nervously laughed my way through the end. Gets a 3 because it could be worse. But not much.A few questions:
1. Why didn't Jon (Aegon Targaryen the dragon) kill Dany and the dothraki with Drogon? Seems like the safest way to make peace.
2. Did Drogon know of the sentimental value of the iron throne? If so, why didn't he kill Jon?
3. Why didn't Jon just escape after that? It must've taken weeks/months to find Daenerys' body.
4. Does it seem likely that the unsullied and dothraki would have kept Jon, the man who murdered their queen, alive? Why not kill him?
5. Would Brienne, Bran, Sansa, Arya and ser Davos laugh at Sams proposal for a democracy with the people? I don't think so. And since they were half of the gathering, why didn't they object to the dismissive laughter?
6. Tyrion says he has thought a lot, and explaines why Bran should be king. Then, when he is asked to be hand, he says he only makes mistakes. If so, why would he express his opinion on who should be king, and that the crown should be elected?
7. Isn't it really rude to call the man you propose to be king: ""Bran the broken""?
8. Will the northern crown still be inherited?
9. Why all the comic relief/cringe in such a special episode?
10. What happened to the dothraki?
11. How could they keep their counsil in King's Landing? The city burned down almost completely.
12. How come Jon greeted Ghost with a pat now, but didn't care when he left? If I had left my pet I would have wept.
13. What did the night king want, really?
14. Were the writers truly satisfied with this ending? It feels like when I write an essay for school, lose motivation and turn it in and hope for the best. However, that only affects me.My expectations for the finale were low. The outcome was worse than I could have ever imagined.",3,20 May 2019,1,1

He convinces Jon to kill her and doesn't give him backing to be freed?
Bron is master of coin? Samwell is grandmaster without completing his studies? For God's sake.If bran was supposed to be the king ATLEAST show SOME screentime for him. WHAT has he done for the past two seasons. He said he doesn't want the throne but why do we think he travelled all this way! Confused dialogue.
Dany was pretty sane throughout the episode and calling her the mad queen is too over the top comparing the mad king who used to laugh at his victims.Question. What was the point of R+L = J? The point of Roberts rebellion? Stretching Jon's parentage and lineage reveal over two season finales? What was the point of aegon targaryen? Why treat him with such importance for in the end to give him the most miserable (other than Dany) plot? He ended up back in the nights watch. The true heirs heritage not discussed, the lords of westeros putting all the burden on him. He looked pretty miserable till the very end scene.

Instead, Daenerys was forced into being of such monstrous form and of such monstrous intent all in a bid to make it easier her story endpoint. Rather than actual well written debate of her politics. So instead they had to make her cross a line that was never going to be forgiven and absolute. At least some awareness within an episode of its reactionary message.Also, the Iron Throne was clearly meant to be Ring of Power from Lord of the Rings though never really alluded to it having any sort of supernatural power so it rather weak but clearly the showrunners point along with Aegon was wrong to even conquer Westeros in the first place.Drogon action was interesting-- I can only assume it was alluding to Drogon having a will and awareness of its own that it didn't like what its Mother had become and done.Not much can be said about Bran - past his dialogue rather implied to me that he manipulated events when he came back from the wall to reach his end goal and prodding, patient- lit the fuse and just waiting for the explosion.

There's nothing wrong with it, if it was done properly but this wasn't the way to do it. Then you have Jon kill her...Also for the love of God why is it that characters can't simply talk? Why must conversations and reactions be cut off to try and entice us? It did nothing but frustrate me. Anyways, now this S*** show is done I can't say I'll be rewatching it again.

The show built up very interesting story-lines and sub-plots but did nothing with them (or at the very least, failed to execute them property). Once the Knight King died in spectacularly boring and anti-climactic fashion, the main theme of the series was over. The fact the main theme ended prematurely meant writers needed to execute the remaining two themes (the rise of Daenerys and the reign of Cersei) perfectly to give us some semblance of satisfaction. Well, they failed miserably. Cersei spent the entirety of season eight looking out a balcony while the death of Daenerys was the most poorly executed, anti-climactic scene of the whole series. The finale was a mish-mash of bundled ideas that gave no meaning to anything that came before it. Bran becomes the King because he has 'good stories' to tell: really? That is how the writers used Bran's journey over the past nine years? No twist, explanation, depth or closure of any lore. This is a common theme - take Johns heritage, for example, seemingly meaningless in the end even though so much time was spent building it up. The finale was littered with boring scenes and illogical conclusions. Grey-worm takes John captive for what reason? Even better, he is suddenly fine with appointing a new ruler?

4408,"Where to begin, where to begin...First, we all need to acknowledge that we entered this season with incredibly high-and not necessarily unwarranted-expectations that very likely could not be met. Unfortunately, I appear to be among the few long-time Thrones fans not screaming bloody murder that the final season and finale were a dumpster fire. At very least, allow me to explain my reasoning and hopefully quell some of the toxic vitriol being spewed about at the moment.SPOILER! - SPOILERS! - SPOILERS! - SPOILERS!- - Season 8 Overall: Pro's and Con'sPro's: -----------
PRODUCTION - I tip my hat to anyone involved with Thrones production that didn't work on the narrative. Between the CGI, set pierces, and....well...almost everything else, the last season looked incredible. Hair and makeup, costumes, set design, choreography, graphics, cinematography, music, etc. Nearly perfect, despite issues with editing and controversial lighting earlier on. Partial credit needs to be given to the suspenseful atmosphere that the dark lighting provided in the first three episodes, despite its backfiring with many fans.BATTLE SCENES - The Battle of Winterfell and the ""Battle"" of King's Landing, despite their flaws, are breathtaking. The former's pure, white-knuckle tension is incredibly difficult to achieve and the latter's chaotic marvel is truly underrated.Con's: -----------
NARRATIVE PACING - This is actually quite all-encompassing, as I'll shortly discuss. I've said it before and I'll say it again: seasons 7 and 8 needed to be full seasons. No questions asked. The finished products were very rushed (though I'd argue season 7 faired quite well nonetheless). This led to little screen time for major characters and greatly impacted the story arcs. We'll get to this in a minute, I promise.TECHNICAL ISSUES - As I mentioned previously, there were a couple issues with certain coffee cups and water bottles making it into the final cut. Cast your claims of lazy editing as you will. As well, for those of us not watching the first half of the season late at night in a comfortable, dark living room, the lack of lighting in the Winterfell episodes was enough to anger many.SIMPLE DECISIONS - Though I won't expand on them in too much detail because the rushed plot addresses most of it, simply narrative choices like 1) Arya killing the Night King rather than Jon, 2) Cersei being crushed by rubble rather than being killed by Arya or Jaime, 3) killing Rhaegal for shock value rather than pitting him against undead Viserion to add weight to the Battle of Winterfell, or 4) the simple unwillingness to kill off more characters during the two largest narrative battles in the show.Overall: 6/10 largely due to the plot. Speaking of which:- - Season 8, Episode 6: ""The Iron Throne"" (specifically, the narrative)Pro's: -----------
CLOSURE - The end to the storylines of Daenerys, Tyrion, Sansa, Arya, and the major Westerosi political players were done quite well with regard to what the story allowed. A better narrative with more time dedicated to it could have done it better, but for what we got, these were among the best ends we could ask for.Con's: -----------
JON'S SENTENCE - We knew going in that Jon would not take the throne. He'd refuse it even if it was given to him. The rightful heir assuming his position as ruler would be far to picturesque for the show. That being said, the fate of Game of Thrones's tragic hero being left up to the political bargaining of the Westerosi leaders felt very cheap and a like hauntingly unfitting drawing of the short straw. With all he has endured, including death, constant conflict, and the forced murder of the love of his life, is his essential banishment really the best we could get?BRAN'S APPOINTMENT - It was made in extreme haste with poor justification and compounded the cheapness of it all with Bran's ""why do you think I've been waiting here all this time"" comment enraging fan feelings of his uselessness in the past two seasons.Overall: 6/10 for doing the best it could with the direction forced upon it. And speaking of that direction:- - Conclusion/My TakeI was quite satisfied with the first two episodes. I liked the character development and thoroughly enjoyed the novelty of so many characters banding together to face the true enemy. The battle itself, as I mentioned, was gripping and terrifying. Despite the lack of major character deaths, I loved every minute of it...until the last few minutes. I knew immediately that Arya killing the Night King was the point of no return. It reduced the White Walker and Three-Eyed plotlines to absolute pointlessness and forced the series's primary villain into a very inappropriate secondary position. Cersei should not have been the show's ""big bad"". As well, this served as a faux reason for Arya's training and struggles. She no longer had the narrative need to kill Cersei which led to her somewhat unfulfilling end at the hands of a collapsing building. As well, we now have no idea what the Night King wanted and are expected to believe that the reason for the Three-Eyed Raven story is for Bran to be king. This is just too jagged a pill.The season should have been 10 episodesThe Battle of Winterfell should have been lostJon should have killed the Night King during the Army of the Dead's attack on King's LandingArya or Jaime should have killed Cersei (though Cersei dying with Jaime is appropriate as well)Jon killing Daenerys was always the correct choice",6,20 May 2019,1,1
4409,"Why has Game of Thrones turned into a soap opera? Having certain nuances of love and relationship is absolutely fine, and can be really great, but here it's as if that's what the writers were trying to make the episode about. Why so much? The whole dialogue between Jon and Dany before he killed her was horrible. The dialogue itself was not impressive, the length of it was dragged way out and almost the entirety of it was unnecessary. If it were half the length, with much less of this ""I love you and you will always be my queen"" crap, it could have been good. I remember the story between Drogo and Dany in S1. That was well written and executed because it wasn't so God damn cheesy. Drogon coming in and melting the iron throne because he had seen what it caused was brilliant. Just stop forcing this whole love and relationship story down our throats. It's not why people watch.Second thing is the crazy rushed writing which is why much of this episode was so bad. When they were sitting in a semi-circle and deciding who were to rule, I had no idea what was happening until I realized that they had probably caught Jon, and found out Dany was dead. What? Was there no time to show Jon being captured, or to capture some of the emotions by the unsullied and dothraki when they found out their beloved queen died? No. Because everything had to be concluded as fast as possible, therefore even important stuff must be excluded. Surprises me that they even fit in that Bran was chosen as the new ruler. The cinematography, acting, directing and CGI were all spot on. The writing is what messes it all up. I enjoyed the last 15 minutes, though. With the small council and whatnot.Previously in the season, I thought D&D were trying their best to please the fans and have everything be as good as possible so I wasn't too hard on them. Writing is a hard task, especially with a series such as GoT. Now I'm not convinced that's the case. Seems like all the writing decisions were made because they wanted to move on to other projects. In the process of getting done as fast as possible, they spat on the now resting grave of Game of Thrones.",2,20 May 2019,1,1
4410,"Dany going all mad queen at the toll of a bell in ep 5 pretty much ruined the series for me. I watched the final episode just for the heck of it.

Such a brilliant show; such complex charracters; such complex story lines and stories to be told by each charachter. All to end like this?

Some stuff seemed to be rushed.I still feel like i'm missing something, many things, in the storyline. What i was hoping for, and most people, didn't happen. One of the best storylines was of Jon Snow, left with what i think is with nothing. While he should be flying on Drogon and keep the peace everywhere;) in the series. And that was what i was hoping for at the end. So a little dissapointed. But it was a great series, with some of the best actors. I hope the roles of Arya, Jon Snow, Drogon:), Bran, Brienne and some others will appear in a spin off. But than again maybe this is enough.
My other opinion is the end of season 8 has been written in a kind of rushed way that i really think there will be spin offs. But i don't know if the viewers of the series got will watch.",5,20 May 2019,1,1

4425,"It always irritates me when people say that the journey is more important than the destination. But for Game of Thrones, I guess they're right. Damn it.The showrunners got the facts of this ending from George R. R. Martin, so it's not bad. But how the story ends turns out not to matter much. The series, like the Night King, was badly wounded in The Long Night (after suffering a rough Season 7). It died last episode with The Bells. This final episode was epically anticlimactic.The pacing and writing was clunky. We do not want to see the Star Wars trilogy these guys are developing. There were no really good scenes. There should have been. Jon Snow riding into the North, finally a free man, should have been great. Weiss and Benioff hobbled this ending by refusing to allow dialogue, and emphasizing the music in a rushed montage. Tyrion's last scene was embarrassing-talking about brothel policy at that point in the show was tone deaf and undermined the epidode's last ditch attempt to end on a high note.Many of the other character endings were just off, like Arya's. Her sailing off to discover America-like King Conan did in the pastiche novels done long after creator Robert E. Howard's death-wasn't stupid. It was just unearned. Bronn's ending was even more unearned. In the end, the TV show came off as a pastiche novel of Martin's original. For much of its run the show had been much better than that.But the finale wasn't truly bad. Just sort of inept. I was grateful that it wasn't as bad as the previous episode. The show didn't end as badly as I had feared. Since Dany and Grey Worm had really lost their characters already, there was no betrayal of characters at the end. I did wonder why Grey Worm didn't kill Jon Snow, but I'm glad he didn't.It was a special show that ended a lot weaker than it began. Lots of things do. Valar Morghulis. But I really hope George writes something better.",3,20 May 2019,1,1
4426,"My title clearly justifies my feeling. I loved this show till 6th season. I know there were many ups and downs in writing till 6th season also but it was still satisfying. But the last 2 seasons are the worst, worst of any show possible. The fans waited for 2 years for this piece of crap. A 5 year old could have written a better last season than the writers. I feel pity for the actors.
Jon Snow is Aegon Targariyan and this was the biggest reveal of the show for the fans but what was it for? What was it's relevance? Jon would have killed Daenerys after seeing what she had done even he didn't knew he was Aegon.
Tyrion's arc has been destroyed from past 4 seasons.
Jamie's death was pointless.
Cersie was killed by her castle in the hands of her lover. I never thought she was the main villian untill the night king died in a single episode without even a fight and the show wanted me to think that Cersie was the main villian but atleast kill the main villian like a villian.
I love Arya's chracter but one chracter can't save such a huge show and her chracter also alongwith Sansa was wasted.
And finally the lord of the 6 kingdoms(not 7 because writers wanted to give Sansa some good lines) , Brandon Stark, the three eyed raven who never wanted to be a king, who did nothing in the war with the night king. His chracter was the worstly written chracter I believe.
And lastly a dragon who is just pissed and sad is freely roaming like a bird as if it would not kill anyone on its life again. You make the dragon slaughter the whole city because it was the choice of its mother but you didn't made the dragon kill the man who killed its mother, the only person it ever loved.",1,20 May 2019,1,1

4429,"This episode wasn't totally pointless.It Looked and sounded great (as always) but that's about it. That's assuming you're not paying attention to what anyone is saying or doing.D&D could stop with stuff like this and maybe do music videos. Just maybe for songs with no real sense to the lyrics (just in case the mess that up too)....Anyway. Let's begin...Nearly a decade building up the plot line and we end with Jon going to live in the woods and every character people like - basically being put into the perfect role (and surviving obviously).D&D and HBO took 2 years to give the finale the show should have deserved. I'm not a fanatic GOT nerd but I loved the show. And I loved it because it was filled with intelligent, unpredictable writing, amazing character development and set in a fantasy world that seemed to unify the real world: whether you're a fantasy geek or not.Everyone seemed to live GOT. It was a talking point for hundreds of millions of people across the world. The build up to the finale was second to none..The ad campaigns of all possible contenders on the throne: pointlessThe night king/white walker arc that had been present since S1EP1: just a gimmick all along. No real substance.Brans real link to him and that plot line: who even cares anymore.I'm fact, we could all sit here and type out every characters development from A to Z and this final season will have ruined each of them in same way. Whether it was characters that made it that far or the memory of ones that didn't. Everyone and everything seemed to get sh*t on. Including the fans.Also worth noting:I genuinely feel terrible for the actors, cinematographers, sound team, costume and SFX crews - in fact everyone baring the writing/direction team.That's their life's work. Many of them grew up as that character. It was no doubt the thing all of them would have been remembered for forever in the best way possible. What's their legacy now?The public is harsh, but rightly or wrongly - when it comes to 'stories' - which is all of a sudden the most important thing according to Tyrion (forget blood lines or 8 seasons of build up - a 20 second speech about basically nonsense trumps all that) - anyway a story is only as good as it's last chapter.The story of game of thrones will be remembered for this final Season. Which is just sad.The way it tied up all the previous seasons aha also left them tarnished. Because... how can anyone watch them in the same way now? Knowing how it all turned out?The beauty of it all was the feeling that it was all building to something incredible. MOMENTOUS.But it never did. So the legacy of the entirety of GOT is now in danger of being ruined. In my opinion it already is.Just quickly: Jons lineage and entire character development for 8 seasons. Pointless? Not even mentioned? Just sent to the wall? Becomes a wildling?Ok I get the poetry - he's a true Northman and is now free etc. But that's so sh*t. The entire build up of us all discovering who he really was. It was pointless.' Aegon Targaryen - the true heir to the iron throne': Now lives in the woods with tormund.Bran ('the broken' apparently): inexplicably the new king. Even though he isn't even 'bran anymore ... not really'Also worth noting - 'why do you think I came all this way (or whatever bulls*it he says) ... fundamentally saying he knew that's how it ended. Does that making him the biggest c*%t in TV history or is that just me?Daenerys went bonkers. Too fast and rushed but fine, I get it. We all get it. But did her character deserve 1.8 minutes of screen time and a death that was more mouses squeak than dragons raw. It was so weak. Her character (and her relationship with Jon) merited something better than that.Don't even get ya all started on driving burning the iron throne as a symbol for ... I dunno something I guess.Arya is like what...a pirate now? So so so rubbish. But whatever. I hated that she killed the night king anyway as it meant the other plotlines were pointless. So she can sod off wherever she likes.Brienne writing in the kingsguard book like it was a diary entry about someone who dumped her but she still liked was cool (it wasn't).The kings council meeting at the end was just embarrassing (is it even worth talking about how gay the book thing was?... probably not).Sansa being 'queen in the north' I also get. But weird that not a single other house was happy to be ruled after seeing how easily bran agreed to sortherm independence (for his sister no less).It was so so neat and tidy. But not in a good way. Sam as arch maester (where the F is gilly btw...). Bronn getting his f'ing castke (seriously no fan cared about that for like 3 seasons)... Tyrion we all love, but...He was rewarded as hand of the king. Jon, a hero of so many wars, and the man who just stabbed the love of his life through the heart to save millions more from the fortunes of kings landing?Off to the wall mate.Anyone fancy arguing a bit more for him? Maybe mentioning his story a bit? Bran? No? No one?... honestly... no one? Ok cool.p.s.Kick ass montage guys (said no one ever).",2,20 May 2019,1,1

Still so many unanswered questions, and with only prequels planned, I don't think we'll ever get the answers to any of them.-What happens to Dany when Drogon flies off with her body?
-What was the point of all the baby foreshadowing last season?
-Jon was brought back because he'd be the one to kill Daenerys, so, with his purpose fulfilled, why is he still alive? Shouldn't he be dead, like Melisandre and Beric?
-Why was Bran elected King when he didn't even want to be Lord of Winterfell?
-Bran can get glimpses of the future, why didn't he just say what was going to happen and prevent it all?
-What was the real reason for Jon's parentage reveal when in the end it was only used to destroy him and Dany's relationship?Just a few, I can think of so many more, but I'll just end up more upset than I already am. So this is how you kill a great TV show. Those 2 writers should be kept as far away from Star Wars as possible.",1,20 May 2019,1,1
4447,"The entire season was very rushed and the pacing could have better.
To potray Dany as a tyrant that too within a span of 1 episode and killing civilians due to a whim is bad writing.The cinematography has been the only thing that has been good this season.",2,20 May 2019,1,1

4449,"For killing his queen. He should have killed himself.
in no world does Grey Worm let him live for killing Daenerys, he would simply have killed him out of pride and respect for his queen. Cowardly thing to kill the queen. in what world would the Queen be left to roam rumbles on her own without any guard.So MANY plot holes in this last episode compared to what the show was about in years past.Jon Snow is a piece of crap for killing her and not taking his own life.",2,20 May 2019,1,1
4450,"This is not only the worst ep in GOT, but it is also the worst final season ever for a TV show.
All those years of good stories and characters development, destroyed in few minutes by bad writing.
I know that since season 7 the show was not good as it used to be but I alwais believe tha a good finale could be a redenption for the show, I was wrong.
I will keep in my mind until the season 6 finale and pretend that 7 and 8 season never happened.
I am sad and disapointed, I am going to cancel HBO forever and never see again another GOT ep.
RIP Game of Thrones.",1,20 May 2019,1,1
4451,"How AWFUL. DISAPPOINTING. WASTEFUL the series finale of what could have been the greatest television series of all time. How the writers made me feel nothing but meh over the course of a few episodes is astounding. Abysmal might come close to the words I am looking for.
The first 30 minutes where they are doing nothing, but looking around, and listening to the speech; is what makes the most sense in this entire episode. Everything else however? Was ok, I cant even say I thought it was bad because I DIDNT CARE. I did not care at all watching the series finale of my favorite show. How did that happen, in yea because of the terrible writing leading up to this episode. It could have been a relatively good ending but the lead up just did not feel deserved, since we deserved better! Also I saw this coming since the plot was leaked awhile ago! Literally everything, maybe that's another reason why I didnt care. I got the blunt of the spiritual damage when It was first confirmed that the leaks were in fact true. The unsullied, and dothraki are A ok after their queen was murdered? Grey worm just decides, oh let me sail to naath to live out my days. Tyrion, the PRISONER decides who the next king will be and to make it worse its BRAN THE BROKEN? WTH and to make it even more worse he knew it all along? Night king shouldve won and killed everyone. There would be no difference.",1,20 May 2019,1,1
4452,"Nothing happens but the one thing people expected 2 episodes ago.
And even that is handled in the least noteworthy, least interesting, least spectacular way.
You though the Night King and Cercei got rushed?
You sweet summer child.But we know who sits on the throne, yay!
At this point I doubt anyone cares in out out of universe.
This whole episode is an epilogue of ep5.
It is embarrassing to watch as the finale of 8 seasons, 8 years of what used to be one of the best TV show ever put on a screen.",1,20 May 2019,1,1
4453,"It is a simply obvious fact that this episode would not be great, however this managed to be worse than expected. The ending of every single character arc has been either completely poorly finished, or thrown the way out of the way.Dany's death had been completely underplayed, Jon barely attempted to change his supposed ""love"" before killing her. While Bran becoming king isn't necessarily a bad thing, Bran had no exploration in why he should be king other than that he knows all. Arya leaving to west of Westeros had been completely illogical, considering the fact that she never cared for that throughout the entire show, including the final season. The idea that the lords of Westeros would allow a bunch of cut throats to make terms with them is unreasonable. In reality Sansa would have ordered Greyworm killed, they are in no position to make any type of requests. Arya would have killed him regardless.
The idea that Tyrion would consider Bran as king over Jon is also absurd, considering that he had asked Jon to kill Dany, and he did. That is in addition to him being the actual rightful king, considering the fact that this idea had been written throughout the show. Jon going North and becoming part of the Night's Watch is completely horrible. They could have written that Jon becomes the king of the true North, or that he and Tormund have their own adventures.This episode clearly shows that D&D will ruin anything that they deem not important. Their attempts at finishing the show at a greater speed had completely destroyed all of the work put in by the other people responsible for the show.",1,20 May 2019,1,1
4454,"That what happens when mediocre and talentless producers are in charge of the legendary story. Once they took separate ways from the books, the show gradually declined. This finale is a fitting end to this mess. D&D killed this once great series",1,20 May 2019,1,1

4458,"Now that it's all done, many questions remain.Why did Cersei only have about 5 scenes in all of season 8, reduced to a tertiary background character?What was the point of having Jon be a Targaryan and promised the throne, the chosen one everyone knew deserved it?Was this final episode a comedy? Some lines were so bad, some scenes cringeworthy in cheesiness, and the choice of selecting a reluctant Bran as the ruler of Westeros were all laughable and so bad they were funny.Was this fan fiction? At one point (when I thought it couldn't get any worse), the thought arose that this could all be fan fiction, that's how bad it was. The only saving grace was that Arya decides to become an explorer, which was interesting.This episode was almost a total failure. Seasons 7 and 8 never should have happened. Dany won the throne and that's the only thing that makes sense. The final 2 seasons were fan fiction by the writers.",3,20 May 2019,1,1

4460,"The finale just felt empty. It just feels too rushed and unsatisfying because of it. It needed more episodes/seasons to help bring all this together.I am still annoyed by how wasted the White Walkers were. No mention of them whatsoever. Just nothing. It has destroyed their scenes now (if you re-watch) and any interest I had in the prequel for them diminished.It's a shame because everything else on this show is fantastic: the acting, the music, the cinematography, all amazing. All the work by everyone else outdone by the extremely poor writing. It's all a lot of people are going to remember.The problem here isn't the fact the story hasn't gone the way we expect or that X died. It's the execution of it all. The speed at which everything is coming together. It is too fast for a show like this that previously built things up slowly.It is clear here that the amount of episodes/seasons the showrunners chose weren't enough. The limited time they had led to this rush to conclude everything. They wanted it done and dusted and it shows.Just hurts to see a show of this calibre go to waste like this. A real shame. Just think about how this show could have gone if the writers were on the level of everyone else that worked on the show. It's the true tragedy of this series.",1,20 May 2019,1,1

There are so many things wrong with that episode that I don't even know where to start and I couldn't possibly cover it all if I tried. The biggest issues are how they for some reason felt that they needed to give everyone a happy ending and appease the fans. I guess they just forgot their fans were adults who liked an exciting, unpredictable, and sensible show. They did Jon so dirty. I've never seen a more appalling end to a character. Worse than dexter.

This episode reflects the real history of humanity, and is perfectly in sync with other episodes of previous seasons. The same twists and turns, unexpected outcomes and nitty-gritty which has accompanied us in the many years of this wonderful TV series, the best I have seen to date. This is the rough, down to earth Game of Thrones, true to its nature, all the way from the very first episode of season 1.

This season was good until episode 4.I agree with the review made by Lilly-Baida.Too many flaws.1. Why would Jon kill Danny simply because Tyrion tell him what will happen? Why not wait until it happen?2. Why doesn't Jon even try to persuade Danny not to wage more wars? Danny loves him. Maybe he can change her and she will be a good queen.3. GOT is the most successful TV series ever created. Why did HBO chose to end it so rush? Why not make one season for night king and another season for the throne?

She ended up being the tragic figure of the series, considering her back story, and 7 years of building her up as the potential hero. But after last episode, and her implying in this episode that she would continue to do more of the same, they had no choice but to give her the ending that she got.

They just won everything they had to win. They go their own ways, they are stronger than ever, they are independant and they are the new leaders of the paths they chose. Arya is being Arya and rules a ship that proudly display the wolf banner. Jon decides to say goodbye to the wall and go live with the wildlings, with his two best buddies. Sansa gets to keep the north and to, once and for all, assume the role of the strong women she has become, as she does not ask, but simply says that the north won't surrender. Bran as king is a new beginning. It is a simply fresh way to go forward, to rethink the notion of power. No more evil kings and queens. Only chosen ones. The concile is perfectly balanced. Every one has a role that fits with their principles. Bronn is perfect as master of coin. Brienne is in the right place. She even does Jaime justice. She's not mad. She is sad to have lost him but honors him anyway. Sam wrote ASOIAF. As we expected. The last seasons had its let downs, and I know my opinion won't be popular here, but this is a perfect wrap up.

4539,"It is very sad and confusing to see people going mad about a show or an episode as great as this. You should think outside the box.
Dany becoming the mad Queen was clear from seasons ago, why all the hate?
Bran becoming a king was obvious, why all the hate?
The hound having his revenge, of course.
The list goes on and on.One can always complain about the plot holes etc. but tell me which show does not have them?
It is true, that a show this big, has millions of fans and everyone cannot be pleased.
But if you really think about this show and watch every season again, then you might see that this is how it was meant to be.Surely, this was not the Best season of GOT, but after all, it is still the most remarkable tv show in history.",9,20 January 2020,11,33

I don't think you could've wrote a better script than this. Man up. Don't hate at everything.

He must be already watch all the prediction...I can't give full 10 point there's part when you feel drag in such bored eps like in eps 4. And feel rushed. But hey see from the industry perspective with the huge cost, and huge deadline project. So i can understand now... good job D&D thanks for this entire decade to bring a good serial that feel real. Total real that turn some of the people that watch it feel hate about it.But for me, it's a good entire serial. Thank youu",9,20 May 2019,8,22

4545,"As it is well known, S8 of GOT has not been more than a dissapointment. But this episode brings the perfect bittersweet ending. Bran as king makes perfect sense as was described by Tyrion, he can see everything from the past and present, making him just, and he desires no power.Furthermore Jon could not be king, he had forfeited his heritage as king in the north and forfeited his title as true heir of the throne when he bent the knee. And finally he became the Queen slayer in order to protect the realm just as Jaime had to once.S8 is bad dont get me wrong, there are lots of plotholes and characters archs doomed, but if you watch this episode forgeting about past episode mistakes, it is indeed the perfect ending for the show",10,20 May 2019,23,81
4546,"People don't get it so they think it's bad. Upon initial viewing, I was like WTF...I had to digest it. Unfortunately, people don't like to think and want things spelled out. The majority of the people downgrading this episode are likely Daenarys fans that are mad.People claim she turned bad in a few episodes. Not true. It's been laid out for you in prior seasons. She has killed innocent people before or at least people not proven of wrongdoing. She burned people when Barristan Selmy was killed trying to find out who was in the Sons of the Harpy. She's mentioned burning cities down but always had someone to talk her down.GRRM wanted to show how power corrupts and Dany has been insufferable the last couple of seasons with talk about taking the Iron Throne. In the end, her lust for power which was shown over seasons not just a few shows was her downfall.Azor Ahai prophecy was fulfilled in my opinion. Jon plunged the knife into Dany's heart and created Lightbringer - Drogon. Drogon destroyed the biggest threat to mankind - the Iron Throne. People are looking for the prophecy in terms of the Night King but Dany's reign would have been the true darkness.Aegon II created the Iron Throne and Aegon VI (Jon) destroyed it.Many people also misinterpreted Jon's fate. There is no wall. Bran tricked Grey Worm to prevent war and get the Unsullied to leave. He essentially set Jon free beyond the wall to be the new Mance Raider.The Starks now run the land and beyond - Bran King of the Six Kingdoms, Sansa - Queen of the North, Jon - King Beyond the Wall, and Arya will conquer what's left.D&D also left this open ended enough to where there could be a sequel movie. Drogon could take Dany to Kinvera. If there is one thing this show taught us is that a knife to the heart doesn't necessarily mean you're completely dead. IMO, they stuck the landing.",10,28 May 2019,22,77

4553,"I think that this is the best ending we could have hoped for with the direction the season 8 was going! It was a disaster as mostly all us agree, but the last episode was a redemption; especially with how some of the characters' fates were resolved.. I mean, I hated how they portrayed Dany's 'snap' into madness, but I think this episode managed to somehow work that out with her speech to her armies, shoring how she thought she was liberating them as she burnt them. And although her death was predictable, I liked Drogon's reaction. It seemed like even he couldn't believe his mother made him kill all those people and forgave Jon for killing her for the greater good.
And as for Jon, I think he had a really good end to his character. Like Tyrion said, you can't always expect children of Kings to be good rulers themselves! And as ""the Queenslayer"", he wouldn't have succeeded as a king and I wouldn't want him as a king with the way he stood idly by as Dany's men and Dany herself slaughtered people of the Kings' Landing.. At least he was a good Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and he will continue being so.. And he reunited with Ghost! At least fans should be happy with that if not with anything else!!!
I also love how Brienne wrote the ending for Jaime in the book of commanders.. It was touching as well as is a relief as Jaime in the books wonders if anyone will write anything good about him except for the few lines it already said opposed to those others who had pages and pages written about their deeds.
All in all, they did their best to resolve the ending of a phenomenal series. Although this could have been a thousand times better if they didn't ruin most of this season, it still is a good enough ending in my eyes..",10,20 May 2019,20,69
4554,"Everyone saying it's rubbish only say it due to them assuming D&D had no input in the series' development in previous seasons. Just because there is no source material to go off doesn't mean you all should automatically complain about a season that was clearly very good. To rate the last episode 5.2/10 is a joke. I get people must be mad that the ending isn't the ending they wanted but cmon there's no reason to be immature about it. It was a good ending, maybe not the ending you wanted but that doesn't mean that the writing was bad or lazy.",10,20 May 2019,13,41

4587,"Please forgive my (sometimes bad) English, my native language is Swedish and I am not planning to use a translator.I first want to specify that I HAVEN'T read A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE and at the time being, I am not sure I want to, at least not jet, not until George R. R. Martin have finished his book series.Of what I've read about the books and heard from friends that have read the published books is that they are far more complex, detailed and complicated, far more than a movie or tv-series can ever be. Therefore I admire HBO and David Benioff & D. B. Weiss courage and bravery of even thinking of making A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE into a tv-series. Hats off to you all!George R. R. Martin (a screenwriter himself) have been building ""his world or universe"" Westeros & Essos since the 1990s in his head. Creating places, religions and people living in that world. And plenty of it!! More than it's physically possible to add to a movie or a tv-series, therefore George R. R. Martin have (perhaps more than once) declined selling the rights to a movie adaptation.BUT George R. R. Martin DID agree to a deal with HBO, and I am sure or at least I hope he had the intention of finishing his book/novel series before all the seasons of the tv-series were over, this he did NOT succeed, at least not finishing the book series before the tv-series now ended. There are still two more books to be published, two more books with characters, intrigues and solutions to problems the readers haven't been introduced to jet.Therefore again, I admire HBO's courage of making a tv-series that (at that point) were mostly/or a huge part of, in one man's head.Even if George R. R. Martin has been a part of the creative process of making the series, (how much I do not know or dare to guess) a lot of details have been in his head after season 5, that is as far as the books takes the readers.IF we'll ever know, what destinies George R. R. Martin had planned for his characters that is completely up to George R. R. Martin himself. The power is still in his hands. If he finishes his books.I read an article about George R. R. Martin some time ago, were he spoke of his own type of writing. That he sees himself as a gardener, he plans seeds that he waters and let evolve.That article explains a whole lot I would say. That statement also tells me, that George R. R. Martin haven't known the story until the story revealed itself for him, fragments by fragment. The ""garden grew"" (as the number of characters, Gods and places) as the story evolved. And as an author that is one way to create. And it also must be a very exciting and intriguing way of creating. But somewhat confusing and complicated, I would think, for those who taken on the task of making this into a tv-series.How did HBO dare to take on such project of making A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE into a tv-series when I author himself did not know there the story were going to end up???I must say, I really can't understand, as a screenwriter George R. R. Martin himself, knowing how complex, detailed and complicated his story and storytelling was and is, how could he ever sell the creative licence and creative use of such story? And give someone else that kind of power, because since his story wasn't finished, he did give that power, that right, to someone else, to HBO.This I admire and almost can not understand! From both perspectives. With this said, again, without of had read the books, I think that S8E6 was a perfect ending, of what HBO were given. Okey, I can agree with others, that season 8 felt a bit rushed, but not as bad as others want to suggest or state. I am not sure if it's true or just a rumour, that HBO originality had 9 seasons planned but changed their mind, making and rewriting the script into those 6 episodes we've now seen. If so, that explains a lot why everything needed to proceed quickly. If so, I guess they had their reasons. Of what I do not know or dare to speculate.A well made ending, that in one way, was one of few endings that makes sense, as ""simple as it might feel"". Beautiful in it's simplicity. As Bran Stark said to Theon ""Everything you did brought you where you are now."" And as true as his words to Theon was, so was also this ending. Everything that the series have built up to, is this. We've actually been given hints of this ending all along if you watch the series again, you'll see it and it makes sense.I did not write A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE or the script to any of the episodes in GAME OF THRONES,
I can only refer to me, myself and my own life. But if I do, I conclude this:
Perhaps there are other solutions to the problems in our own lives, than the ones we see ourselves, maybe there are better ways to live our lives than what we have done until now, but who we are now, are a product of the choices we've made along the way. Good or bad, the choices we make or the decision we take, form, make and create us and our lives. (Regardless if we want it or not) We are the result of the choices we have made. So is this story.Who am I to judge someone else's story? As well, as who are you, to judge someone else's story or life, when I or you haven't lived it? It all comes down to preferences and choice. It doesn't matter how amazing someone say a specific beer is, if I don't like beer, I will never enjoy it. Beer is not something I will never learn to love. It's about preference and choice, nothing else.Okey, I see that people take this series and especially this season, very personal, that this was not the ending they or I foresaw or had wished for, but it all led to this.
I must admit after last episode I wasn't sure what to expect, but I did see Daenerys transformation coming weather I liked it or not.Daenerys was not born as the person she became, even if was her father's daughter, she was formed of the life ""she lived"" (we're still taking about a fictional character here, living in a made up world, even if some people on the internet seem to know her more personal than that) therefore she became a person who could burn down the capital to get, what she her whole life thought, she wanted or had the birthright to claim. We've followed her since she was a sweet innocent girl, seeing her evolve into a leader, a warrior queen and finally a tyrant.The entire series has been about a game/a war, A GAME OF THRONES.
There will always be heroes, enemies and casualties in wars. Someone's hero will be someone else's enemy, that is the facts of war. And in wars there will never be a completely happy ending, there will always be losses on both sides. Weather we like it or not, weather we are on the loosing or winning camp, there will be losses. GAME OF THRONES led us here.I think Tyrion summed it up quite well in his dialogue with Jon Snow. I say no more of that.If George R. R. Martin would have finished his A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE earlier, if the creators could have read the last chapter before they made the last season, maybe or perhaps we've would seen a different ending. But as long as that or those final chapter/chapters are still in one man's, in George R. R. Martin's head, the creators (HBO, Benioff & Weiss) have their creative rights to do what they mean is the best way to solve ""the problem"" of who is going to rule over the 7 or now 6 kingdoms.Everything HBO built up to, led to THIS, nothing more, nothing less. Again, as Bran Stark said ""Everything you did brought you where you are now.....""If anyone is to blame in this matter, how (the ****?) GAME OF THRONES ended up this way, it is the author himself George R. R. Martin for not giving the readers, HBO and us all the chance to read the last chapter/chapters just jet. No one but him, George R. R. Martin know for certain how it all would end (except perhaps his wife).HBO been judged VERY hard based on this season. A bit TOO hard I would say.
Only if George R. R. Martin made his series completely on his own then it could have been made it different and completely accordingly with his own mind and thoughts if HE, himself have had the means to use millions and millions to build up his world anything close to what HBO really HAVE accomplished.I thank you George R. R. Martin, for giving HBO the chance of life trying to recreate your world, your universe, (You didn't give them an easy nut to crack, did you? Or at least as it seems to me as a spectator). So please finish the books, so we all can read how YOU might have solved it (perhaps differently). Perhaps, even I will read it, you see, I don't like to read books that has no ending. I like to read all the chapters, because every story deserves an ending. Please George R. R. Martin please sit down and finish A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series.I say THANK YOU to all the actors which made all the characters so much alive and lifelike (that it has created a storm surrounding the entire GAME OF THRONES series) you've all done an amazing job!! All of you, regardless how small or great role you've played. Friend or foe. You've been amazing. Thank you!!Thank you HBO for an intriguing series! Wow, what an accomplishment, intriguing story, amazing casting of actors and showing us beautiful filming locations and surroundings.Last but not least, THANK YOU David Benioff & D. B. Weiss for an honorable ending. Showing us that even a place like the seven kingdoms, (where previously family and blood ment more than who you are as a person), could become a place of democracy or as close to that a medieval time would allow.

4588,"I cannot believe the backlash of this episode. All of these people complaining about arc narratives, character development and alternative endings instead of enjoying the end of one of the greatest show ever.
It is true that it could have been better, with a bit of more action and avoiding a slow-paced ending, but, even so, it is not so terrible. Overall, it is a good ending.
Sincerely, I cannot believe you may rate this episode with 1 star. And besides, is it your story to tell? No, it does not have to end like you want and you do not get to decide because it is not your story. So, keep calm and enjoy it.

4589,"I started binge watching Game of Thrones a month ago on Crave and finished the series finale last night and thought the ending couldn't have been better. Great show, super characters,exciting stories and spectacular battle sequences. So many negative comments from people regarding the last season are really hard to believe. I'm not sure what they expected.I liked it and really that's all that matters.",10,20 May 2019,10,30
4591,Jon killed Dany for the good of all the 7 kingdoms. Every character achieved what they've always wanted. Arya. To be on her own and be in dependent. Sansa. To have the north be it's own kingdom and for her to be the queen of it. And Jon. To be north where he truly belongs. People are mad because the show didn't go how they wanted it too and that's why I loved it.,10,20 May 2019,18,62

4595,"Im absolutely speechless, I am beyond moved. Im stunned!
Many mistakes ( episodes 3 and 5 were little dissapointment ) are covered because of this wonderful episode.
Loved Peter Dinglake ( he does very good job: in season 7 and first 5 episodes he doesn't act so good as for example in season 4) and the scene when he throws away a mark of queens hand, hes conversation with Jon, and every appearance what he did.
The scene when Jon kills Dany was sad and Beautiful....
Drogon carries he away and boy I was so sorry for Drogon.
Every starks scenes was perfectly directed, acted and writed: Conlusions were perfectly made. Arya travels, Sansa is finally queen on the North and Jon goes to North were he belongs.
Directing was absolutely breathtaking: every detail was shooted so perfectly.
The music and effects was stunningly good. Touching ending, my heart is breaking.
I don't understand the hate of this episode. Like stephen king said: ""every good things....""
Now I wait Winds of winter and how GRRM ends this story.
Next I hope the westworld season 3 succeed. The first season was phenomenal and I compared it to GOT. Thank you HBO you made it again.",10,20 May 2019,31,118

4598,"First of all a want to say that i have a HUGE respect for all the actors and all the crew who made this show, in no way i'm criticising their hard work, they did an unimaginably brilliant job but i can't say the same for the work that the writers did in season 8. I feel so empty inside after watching this season, i have no more words to describe the lack of any sense, logic and continuity in this show. I am not going to review this mess of an episode, i am just going to ask a few questions that i had while watching this finale to show you how the show was totally ruined, butchered, murdered, slaughtered, killed. So here goes:Last episode The Dothraki were murdering and raping everyone in the city and now they are shown just calmly strolling around the streets with others like its totally okay now and everyone forgot about it?How did Daenerys turn from a ruler who always tried her best to listen to her council into literally hitler who thinks burning men, women and children and destroying the entire city is liberating them and wanted to 'liberate' the whole world and this rapid transformation took only 1 episode?Why Jon Snow justified Daenerys' actions so it took Tyrion almost half an episode to convince him she was hitler? Wasn't it obvious to him already?! Why even have that conversation with Tyrion?Why Grey Worm suddenly started taking hostages (Tyrion, Jon Snow) while just minutes ago he was going crazy executing and murdering everyone without his queen orders?Why Grey Worm wanted justice for Tyrion and Jon, resisting the urge to just kill them both only few minutes later to be totally fine with everything and leaving the Kingdom?What was Davos even doing in the meeting of the lords? He admitted himself he has no place there and no right to vote.How come Tyrion trial slowly turned into King elections started by the man who was on trial?!Why did all the lords got immediately swayed by a traitor man in chains who just 5 minutes ago had no right to even say a word?How come none of the lords complained about Bran becoming the new King?How come Bran had a 'better story' then anyone else, while Jon Snow from no one became the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, the man who killed White Walker, died, got resurrected, united everyone against the Night King, became the King in the North, flew on a dragon... protected people from the Night King and killed Daenerys, the most dangerous character in the whole history of Westerns? What did Bran do that was better than all of this?Why did none of the lords complain about House Starks taking over Seven Kingdoms? There were zero objections.Why did none of the lords complain about Sansa' independence?, Why no one, even Yara didn't demand independence in response?Why did Sansa want independence from his own brother in the first place? Was she just powerhungry and they never showed it in the show?Why did they even bother with all the Jon Snow being Targaryen story line if it didn't even matter in the end?Why Bran as an elected King never mentioned Meera Reed and House Reed (who is a vassal of The House Stark!) for protecting his life from numerous threats to him. Meera dragged his disabled body for weeks\months in the barren dangerous lands north of the Wall. Meera and her house were just blatantly forgotten.Why Tyrion spend so much time in this episode convincing Jon that he can be a good ruler and then never mention him to the lords or anyone else ever again?Why Sansa, Bran and Arya never proposed or EVEN mentioned Jon Snow as a better candidate for the new King??? Wasn't that his family? Did they just betray him and let him rot on The Wall?Whats up with Arya suddenly going exploring distant lands? She literally said she wanted to stay with her family 2 episodes ago. Where did that even come from? To subvert expectations for the sake of subverting expectations?! Or because the writers for long ago didn't know what to do with Arya after she killed The Night King?Why didn't Jon just return to Seven Kingdoms after The Unsullied left? No one else complained about his actions. After all Jon did the only thing he deserved is getting send to The Wall?Why is Bronn the Master of Coin and not the Master of War?! He was the Leader of King's guard before. Bronn in season 3 was shown as literally having no understanding of how economy works at all.Who made Sam the Grandmeister? Other Meisters should have elected him and i 100% sure they wouldn't.What's up with 'The Song of Ice and Fire'? Is to confuse everyone just for the sake of confusing everyone?Why wasn't Tyrion mentioned in it? How can you not mention a man who killed Tywin Lannister, a mastermind behind the Battle of Backwater. A man who was a hand of the King Joffrey and a Hand of Daenerys? Was it just to troll the fans? Was it supposed to be funny?Who was Varys writing to? No one? It didn't even matter in the end? Why even show that scene then?So Bran was like ""i don't want to rule"" and ""i don't want anymore"" for these two seasons. And now when asked what is he doing in King's Landing he is like ""why do you think i came all this way?""!? So he was just a lying all this time?So Bran knew hundreds of thousands of people would be burned to death in King's Landing but he just let that happen AND he revealed that he knew it AND the rest of the lords STILL elected him to be the King??? WITH NO CONFLICT OR DEBATE WHATSOEVER???Who is Grey Worm and why his opinion matters so much in the Seven Kingdoms that everyone decides that a King in the North and a rightful heir to the throne who just killed a lunatic queen who murdered everyone in KL deserves nothing more then sending to the Wall? Did all the Seven Kingdoms were afraid of a few thousands of unsullied? Really?WHERE DID THE DOTHRAKI EVEN GO? They just evaporated just as mysteriously as they appeared? Were they totally okay with Daenerys being murdered while they were cheering for her just few hours before?How did Jaime and Cersei managed to die while the whole place was perfectly fine and only where they stood there was a little pile of bricks? They were literally covered in one layer of bricks, it took Tyrion less then a minute to uncover them.How convenient that all the rooms of the Red Keep that were needed for the shots were completely intact. Why did all the interiors looked like they are in perfect condition? Did they rebuild it all in a few weeks?Why did Bran mention that he can try and find Drogon...and then never doing it? What was the point of that line then?Did Jon just told everyone that he murdered Daenerys? There was no one there to see who did it and there was no sign of Daenerys and Drogon. The throne room just had a puddle of blood and a melted Iron Throne. How hard would it be to convince The Unsullied it was Drogon who did it and then left?What is the point of Night's Watch even?!Is there still a hole in The Wall? If so then what's the point of The Wall? If not then did they rebuild it? How and who did it?!Why did Jon immediately abandoned his duty and went north of The Wall?Why free folk returned to the barren lands? Wasn't the whole point of all this union to give them fertile lands south of the wall in the end? Isn't that what Jon wanted to do for them?But the main question for these entire series is: WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BABIES SACRIFICE AND CRASTER PEACE PACT WITH THE WHITE WALKERS? Wasn't the Night King and the White Walkers kinda the whole point of this entire show?I am sure some fans can come up with many more questions JUST for this episode alone, not even the whole season, that remained unanswered. This took 2 years to make. I honesty can't even rate this as 1\10, this does not deserve a 1.I honestly believe it couldn't have been done worse than that. Game of Thrones will remain in history as the worst television series of all time, weird, because just few years back they were the best series of all time.",1,21 May 2019,7,19
4599,They did not deserve it without proper insight of why these two main characters changed so much in the last two episodes. We did not deserve it either! After 8 seasons you should not have rushed the finale for your own purpose of getting out of GoT!!,1,21 May 2019,7,19

They are mad because their theories didnt come true...
of course i agree with all the negatives this season have: polr writting(episode 4 tyrion qyburn conversation for example...) and character development has been thrown down the drain.
BUT I am satisfied with the ending.
Not with all of it of course (danys death and drogons reaction...)
But the starks...
Arya: whats west of westeros (great)
Sansa queen in the north (honoring her family)
Bran king (its right and deep down we know it)
Jon back where he begun (i personally find it poetic. Plus, he came back from the dead to kill the person he loves, that was his destiny)

Writing an end to this epic is infinitely harder than a hate piece rant on IMDbI enjoyed this from start to finish. It became popular so all the hipsters think it's fashionable to criticise.If I don't like something I stop watching. You couldn't though. You had to watch until the end. That to me says it all. We've witnessed the end of arguably the greatest TV show we'll ever see. For those not yet to watch it. Ignore the keyboard warriors and just enjoy the end of something that will never be repeated.A fitting end that answered everything to me. Goodbye Game of Thrones it's been epic.",10,20 May 2019,16,54
4610,"I kind of feel the same way as I felt about Lord of the rings. If that was broken down into a TV show, the endings would be very similar. Not a lot happening at the end. There was a lot I did like, I knew and understood why Dany's arc ended as it did, but it's still very sad. I didn't like how one minute Dany was killed and then the next scene was the meeting of all the lords and ladies. Tyrion messing about fixing chairs was time that could have been used bridging that gap.
Season 8 would have been a decent story if it wasn't squashed into 6 Episodes. That's what spoiled it for me. Not the story.
Was also shocked that was really the end of the white walkers. I guess the nights watch can just chill in the lands of always winter now then. At least he got his reunion with Ghost 💖
At least Dany's prophecy was true. No lightbringer though.
The cinematics were incredible, and the music was simply gorgeous. I think I am happy with the end. I cried a lot of the loss of characters. I am just hoping George finishes the last two books sometime soon. Then at least I can get my GoT fix.",10,20 May 2019,25,92

Sure, dialogue isn't as snappy but the tone of the episode is absolutely fitting.Aside a few minor things, i found it thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.",10,20 May 2019,11,34
4613,"Though 2DB have been rudely push the script to finish the goal of democratization, the ending is fairly good. I almost cried out when the dragon knew who is REAL murder of Danny.

It would be better to put more explanation in the beginning about the evil side of her history.",10,20 May 2019,11,34
4614,"The reason for the 10 star is not for this episode, but for the season as a whole. Game of Thrones has truly been a treat, one of the greatest TV shows ever created, despite this rushed season. I can understand that a lot of people are going to hate this episode, and I can understand that. I didn't love this episode, but I didn't hate it either - I was disappointed.Season 8 has been very rushed, but I have enjoyed it - has it been the best season? Absolutely not! But it hasn't been bad, it has had some great moments throughout. And I don't think anyone can deny that it is one of the best made TV shows ever, the visuals and production is flawless and perfect.As for this episode, there are a lot of things that I didn't like, from the very underwhelming Daenerys death. I liked the scene where she approached the throne, it was a good scene, but the part where Jon kills her felt very anticlimactic. She has been one of the toughest characters in the show, and has been through a lot since season 1, but she dies like that? I didn't like it. However the scene where Drogon arrives, and sees his dead mother, was amazing, and I loved how he took his rage out on the throne, instead of Jon. It was almost like Drogon was saying, ""if my mother can't have it, no one can."" And the last scene of him carrying Dany off was a beautiful moment, it is a shame her death was poor. Another thing I didn't like was that Jon Snow is now right where he started, a no one who has been sent off to the Nights Watch! WTF?! You can say that he is a free man, now that he is with the Wildlings, and I am sure he will be king of them. I'm sure the fans will like that he actually embraced Ghost in this episode. But I didn't like that he was cast aside, and sent away to be nothing.There were good things in this episode, from the closure of some of our beloved characters, like Sansa now Queen in the North, and Arya, who is going to become the next Christopher Columbus, by exploring the unknown. From Sam becoming Maester, to Bronn becoming Master of Coin, Davos the Master of Ships and Brienne the Commander of the City Watch. Truly great closures for these amazing characters. And how can we forget Tyrion? I did think he was going to die this episode, and I am glad they didn't kill him, I would have hated that. But seeing him as the Hand of the King, setting up a new era, was a fitting end to his story.But can we all talk about Bran? That took me by surprise. ""King Bran the Broken, First of his name."" Don't get me wrong, I think Bran will be a great king, but I doesn't seem right to me. But I do like that they will adopt a new tradition, of selecting a new ruler instead of one being born. But Bran Stark as king? It was so out of the blue and bizarre that I almost laughed.There really isn't much to say about this episode, it did make me swallow a lump in my throat, some great and emotional farewells, but it all feels rushed. Why did they make this 6 episodes? I HAD to be 10!! This isn't enough for the last season of the most beloved TV in the world right now, I wanted more. And I hate it!Game of Thrones will surely be missed, I have loved the journey - the series gets a 10/10, but this episode gets a 6/10. It should have been spread out over more episodes.",10,20 May 2019,37,145

4628,"Many people are upset by this episode, primarily because it did not agree with their beliefs as to how the show should end. A pity as their bias made them miss out on a satisfying and logical conclusion.Dany was NEVER a feminist hero. She was a vengeful tyrant, increasingly murderous for the smallest slight. Jon and Tyrion realized this and both knew what had to happen.Bran makes sense as it bring it all full-circle. Plus a Stark King with a Lannister Hand contains a strong message of treating people as individuals not groups.Sansa asserting her right as Queen of the North shows her development. A wallflower turned into a strong ruler. Hers was the hardest of roads and she deserves her title.The end of the Iron Throne was one of the series most poetic moments. This grotesque--and seemingly uncomfortable--piece of furniture got what its deserved for centuries. While the nobles rejected the idea of democracy, they did decide on an old-style republic, suggesting Westeros was evolving.An additional word needs to be said about Peter Dinkledge's performance. He turned from the despised ""imp"" who turned to drink and sex to becoming the voice of reason. His performance was magnificent.And so, we have Queen of the North Sansa. Jon back at the wall. King Bran advised by Tyrion, and Arya sailing off westward. Hopefully, she'll not wind up in New York, detained by ICE agents.",10,20 May 2019,13,42

4630,"The ending was satisfactory. The story was about the fact there are no saviours, for saviours bring zealotry as well, even in our secular age, communism brought genocides to own people, post colonial leaders who led freedom soon descended into tyranny,dictatorship. The magic has to end, the wielder of the wand has to depart as well. It has been hinted many times that republic was going to be the final destiny.And who better to lead the republic than the all seeing leader who isnt seen as threat by anyone and also has support of the many, with little help from the hand?. We began this story with the heartbreaking story of the starks and we end with them in the end. ""Love is the death of duty"". Only the one who knows this can stand up when it really matters, And the only one who can stand up to this trial is the one who has given up titles, name, children. It takes a selfless man to make this happen. And GRRM has shown the one place where such men can be groomed in this world . It is with this bit of selflessness and the man who can show this that the show ends.",10,20 May 2019,13,42
4632,"It was inevitable for Dany to die at the hands of Jon to sort of fill the prophecy of Azor Ahai and when Drogon destroys the iron throne this is basically him breaking the wheel (or foreshadowing the breaking of the wheel) and when they all elected bran as the new ruler it was best for the kingdom. I feel that they should've had an after credit scene showing something to do with the location far north beyond the wall we were introduced to in the earlier seasons but that was left out. I believe personally that a miniseries sequel would fit perfectly to see what happens after with Drogon missing and Bran on the Iron thrones remains. I will admit, it was fairly anti climatic with things an extra, short episode maybe a certain period of time into the future,would've solved. Even with that flaw I'm gonna have to rate it 10/10",10,20 May 2019,26,97
4633,"I think it was a great episode. Even though I didn't enjoy the story of episode 5, I'm glad at least the finale got a good episode.
Yeah I do feel like Dany's character was a bit of a waste. Supporting her for so long only to have her values thrown at the window and then killed in the end. I wish so much that she could've been Queen in the end. It would have made for a beautiful albeit predictable ending that viewers would enjoy. But I understand that this was the plan all along. I feel like they could've have prolonged her anger, not just switch to mad queen in one episode.I understand that she had to be killed. That scene was beautifully done, including the burning of iron throne.Was nice to have a little closure on Cersei and Jamie as well. I love that they showed that. Because it didn't seem enough in episode 5.In the end I'm happy. Was a great Stark ending. Sansa looked amazing. I was happy with Jons end as well. I'm glad they didn't make him king. Small council meeting was a cute final moment for loveable characters.I understand some viewers not enjoying the final season. They definitely should have prolonged the ending. It was rushed. Episode 5 I definitely did not enjoy. But I did enjoy The Long Night, even with the darkness I loved it. Many characters had happy endings which was good.

Great acting from all involved in scenes that I had no problem with whatsoever. It's in the second half that things fall apart, with a pat, rushed, happy ending for most of the characters. Arya inexplicably swans off to who knows where; Sansa makes unreasonable demands and somehow gets them accepted; as for the presence of Bronn, and a simpering Brienne, and Sam as Grand Maester - what?!

But there was no reward, just abysmal writing that had to give us these spoonfed -cheeseball - explaining-the-plot dialogue sequences that were vomit inducing. Left with no element of surprise even when leading up to what was supposed to be one of the three most shocking revelations of the series.If you didn't know Jon was going to kill Dany by the end of episode 5, don't worry, they sure as hell let you know it with that Tyrion-Jon scene. Remember all the puzzle boxes and scheming that went on throughout this world in prior seasons? There has been nothing clever of the sort. It proves to me they had to kill off characters like Little Finger when they did because he outsmarted both of the writers. With Tyrion we get a glimpse of what D & D's writing is without the GRRM source material. I wish they would have said that being around Dragon Fire causes your intelligence to lower at an alarming rate, at least that would have given all of our main characters finishing story arcs rationality. Just barf..",1,20 May 2019,3,6
4698,"This line from Arya summed up this episode and season 8 very well. Talk about stating the obvious.Daenerys has just needlessly murdered everyone in Kings Landing, the place is still on fire and it's still takes half of the episode for Jon to be persuaded that perhaps his allegiances are misplaced.Everything about this series has been rushed and I'm afraid the final episode is a perfect example of this.Series 8 has gone from bad to worse with absolutely no character development. In fact it has destroyed virtually every character that had been so masterfully created in the early seasons. Daenerys and Tyrion are without doubt the two best examples of this.I'll always cherish the early seasons as the best television ever made but sadly this final series will hang over the show for years to come.",1,20 May 2019,3,6

But I loved this episode!I loved first for the directing tone that gives us an ending feeling.The characters can't erase the disrespectful bad writing of the previous episodes, but precisely in this chapter theirs decisions and reactions fits in a very logical way, considering the whole series.The sequence that Daenerys flirts with the iron throne is absolutely beautiful, and so are her killing, Drogon's crying and raging against the throne (sparing Jon, the only Targaryen alive), and finally Drogon flying away with the body.That stabbing is such a sacrifice for Jon, but he can't deny his duty as the true Hero of the history. Remember: After killing thousands of womans and childrens in King's Landing, Daenerys was planning to carry war to all Westeros, including Winterfell.About the king choosing:
Kingslayer Jon can never be a king. Nor be executed without causing a war in the North. Neither be freed up without causing a war with the Danny's remaining army. The Wall was the tempered choice of the new king. Three Eyed Raven was the only unanimous possibility among the voters, and that fits very well in the major plot. The new rule for choosing kings thru representative votes instead of bloodline, was a legacy of Daenerys will.Sansa's objection is justified by the particularities of the North region, and makes a reward for serving as ""the shield that guards the realms of men"" in the Great War against the Night King. Sansa as the queen in the North is perfect.The two Starks heroes can't live without a mission, so they found one. Arya exploring the seas and Jon leading the wildlings home.After Jon, the Targaryens will be extinct. No more gods throwing coins.For a moment, i forgot the messed rest of the season.

To the Haters, You aren't true GOT fan.
Go, read Comic books. GOT is not for you.Now, talking about this episode...from the starting..you start getting the feeling of the typical GOT Goosebumps.The way they showed the aftermath is just fantabulous. I can surely say that, Ignore the Haters...This season is show far the best Season when it comes to Direction and Cinematography.Maybe the rushed a bit..but that's OK for me.
I can understand they had to complete everything in just 6 episodes. I would appreciate the kind of effort GOT creators put in to make this season memorable.For Haters, Do you have any guts to write something on your own or you just know how to put up fancy fairytale theories,it's like without your theories..GOT can't be completed. Go..get a life.And particularly, about this episode....Now, I can die in peace.Kudos..😍😍😍",10,20 May 2019,13,43

4752,"CAUTION DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN! The best way to describe it and I see the creator George R. R. Martin has the very same sentiments. Daenerys Death was heavily foreshadowed , Drago taking her body was poetic as well flying east into the sun. The mystery continues as Bran the Broken is now ruler of the 6 Kingdoms. IMDB ran a photo gif of Daenerys sitting on the Iron Throne, she never does. Jon is united with Luna while being returned to the north to be Nightswatch once again. Beautifully poetic. Not the gangbusters I expected , Beautifully finished.",10,20 May 2019,70,305
4753,"Epic, self-ironic, glowing cooling down, consequent. Dany simply fulfilled her destiny, freed the world from tyrants, not surprisingly she was the last one herself and had to die, frankly I expected it would be Arya after the cruelty she had to face while Dany burned down the city but Jon makes more sense. What a brilliant idea to let the last dragon melt down the evil iconic iron throne, the ultimate weapon wipes out the symbol of merciless reign, outstanding. And the wise Bran takes over a modern less-royal position, just out of a sense of duty along with the one and only imaginable hand, the true giant of the series, he always was.
Great work. Thanks guys for an epic ending after 8 (not always) epic seasons without taking everything too seriously, only a wink in the eye enables the true depth.

4755,"And Tolkien is still only a bit better. Like a single or two levels at most. But I called it from the get go, like how facebook would spy on people and become so useless and hollow. At least there was an ending, but what a let down. I cant even compare it to the Seinfeld ending , they are just so different in their seamless lack of effort. This is why I never wanted to get into a popular, lesser excuse of a middle fantasy show. I was prodded, and must finish what I started , much to my chagrin. So little is well made anymore I feel like a cantankerous old jerk 3 times my age. But I always tell people, yet I get sucked in my that one friend...
""Six episodes is not enough. And little more than an hour and episode is too little"" I would say. Like when a movie should be R rated but its Pg 13 at best. Wheres is the foresight? And this is coming form a guy that got sucked into the show. For all the things I liked, there was more I just questioned as being poorly written in the shows entirety.
So we have the lowest grade ( C grade, which is bad enough) of middle fantasy (low<mid<high), beneath even the somewhat stagnant but popular Middle Earth Franchise where people are also divided, got help form the last ""Elves"" and magic literally and figuratively disappears from the world.
How. Bitter.
People thought GoT wasnt just some ""4th age"" like tale, so it would not be disappointing? HBO has made its bones and riches off of people eating up the same slightly dark, boorish, slightly tantalizing adult fare for years. At least it wasnt the total terrible ending I was prepared for. But give us a break!
This was literally the Sopranos crossed with HBO's Rome series, and so much from the Lord of The Rings and Star Wars here and there. You got a sister and brother that are the main characters, but they dont know it, and one is more powerful than the other, though the other is more of a born leader. Oh sure, the fine details were altered enough to fool people, but once you see a former champion level warrior brought back by dark methods and put in a big black suit like Darth Vader...*sighs *.
Then comes the stabbing of ""Danny"" the Dragon Woman, whom would have done more for her character if she gasped with her last breath:
""E Tu, Johnus?"" and took 2 minutes to overact before dying.
Her demise at Johns hand was both obvious and fleeting. All the incestuous, betraying natures of aristocrats aside, I cant have been the only one that would have preferred to either see Daenyris change her ways, or instead more brutally die in payment of her wrongdoings.Oh but the poor eunahcs got to live, even after butchering a whole nation. The whole point of the tale was Not to give in to Tyranny! Yet this Dragon Corp just began a full scale takeover in the harshest way. Everyone is a killer in the show! Wheres the redemption?
Flash forward a few weeks or a month, and the positions people ended up in for the new regime were hollow and unsatisfying. There was no further exposition or exploration of their individual circumstance. Even Tyrion gets the short end of the stick, and theres no pun intended, he should have gotten a better ending. The very book the show is based upon even shows up. A Song of Fire And Ice, which sounds like the cartoon film from 1983 or the 1920s poem by Robert Frost is said to chronicle events in Westeros that lead to the final episodes time period. And Tyrion was literally told he was kept out...WTF?!
No seeing Tyrion old, rich, powerful, with great grandchildren to carry on the Lannister name in an honorable and intelligent manner. No dying drunk on wine with a fine harlot on him. No seeing if Brianne of Tarh was pregnant with Jamie Lanniste's child. Sansa Stark is left alone as queen in the north to once more create a rift and divide the kingdoms in a way that will come back to bite them all in the bum years later. Arya leaves her sister to go exploring without the faceless man showing up for one last fight. No interesting twist or satisfying conclusion for anyone, let alone those on the ""knifes edge"" of their seats. Will Arya get her own spinoff or a voiceover animated series or comic of her eastern exploits? Probably not.
And John just up and heads north, leaving the night watch to go with the Wildlings. Maybe theres another sexy redhead lass his age and type out there, kissed by fire and just perfectly not working on her tan lol.
And Bran, whose just done nothing at all ever, just gets wheeled out of his own council meeting like some infirmed ward. This almost makes Tyrion defacto ruler by proxy, as his sister Circe had been from episode 1. This is how people get drunk with power, thats just repeating the cycle.
Brans character just goes off "" All things are as they are fated to be, because I just know they are."" and that is that. Not trying to point fingers at some ""devious feminist plot"", because even the womenfolk didnt seem happy in the shows ending, but Not A SINGLE person with a functioning penis is in charge or happy either. Quite literally a whole armada crewed by men with so little prowess they just up and accept Johns triffling punishment, and go away.
""Oh well, our beloved queen is dead we destroyed nations, and we have nothing, including no manhood...Anyone for Unsullied Manwich for lunch?""
No redemption, no prospects for children to undo generations of hate and years of strife. Nobody to carry on a nobler tradition for once and better the world after the deaths and subjugation of countless people or generations beyond memory cursed with the ""gift"" of undeath.
Theres also supposedly no chance of future generations holding onto old grudges all Hatfield and Mccoy like, but that assumption gives little comfort.
Theres a queen in the north. OH but its okay because representatives from all over, including Dorn crowned Brandon. They are family, theres no way family would ever feud or vie for power...WHOOPS! The starks just rule everything, like the Lannisters practically did. Thats so criminal.
Will there be a movie to finish things up, like Deadwood is getting after so many years? I hope so...but hope is a poisonous thing when not balanced with reason and experience.
Just forget a dragon is out there clutching its dead mistress and eating its feelings with however many people as its comfort soul food.
Nevermind a whole city was raised and tens of thousands slaughtered.
The throne is gone, none could have it. So much for lofty ideals and goals that skew the sight of whats really important. Was that the message? Nope. No message, just a mess.
And to think, this all could have been avoided if the aristocrats in question were realistic and just poisoned each other from the get go, like proper blue blooded baffoons. One less thing to eat up my time. No tie, no sudden death. The Games just suddenly over, and nobody won. 6/10 Now go away.",6,20 May 2019,10,31
4756,"Farewell..Started at the top and ended at the top.
Good job creating this peace of art of a show and a story and thank you for a calm ending for a wonderful mad world.Why John killed Danny? He wanted to protect the people from a new mad king!
Dragon didn't kill John? He is a Targaryen!
Why Bran? Didn't you hear what Teryan said!With all do respect to everyone who didn't like this season you are without a doubt an stubborn idiot. This is the same show that we loved years ago but what i see is people got hocked up on stupid theories that would perfectly fit for an Indian movie not GOT. Also, because this is the end they are questioning everything and hating everything. After 8 years of what happened in Westeros can't you expect a calm ending or for the very least accept it?What the did you want?
A new season about Sansa not bending the knee to Danny?
Dragon killing John and starts a war between the northmen and the Unsullied!I honestly feel sorry for all the people who couldn't wait for season 8 and read all the theories and then decided which one is the best one for him and now he can't enjoy this show because the picture of season 8 in his mind is different than what it is.

Giving the episode such low ratings because of the mistake of one department would be an insult to the others.
Just like giving the episode a 10/10 rating is wrong, so is giving it a 1/10 rating. This was the best series finale they could give us after messing up almost two seasons.

4767,"I rate it the best episode of an absolutely dreadful season. Come on people, the finale wasn't that bad. The earlier episodes with Cersei & Jaime's boring demise, Arya killing the night king who turned out to be a pointless character, the battle where you couldn't see what was happening on the screen - these were 1/10 episode. But this one wasn't so bad.I actually liked the ending with Jon going off with the wildlings, Tyrion doing what he does best, and Sansa getting the North.People seem to be upset that Jon didn't win the throne. Yes, he's Aegon Targaryen & rightful king, however, he 1) wouldn't want it after needing to kill his lover to get there, & 2) there's no way the Dothraki or the Unsullied would ever permit it.People also seem to be upset over how Drogon burned the throne instead of Jon; however, I think you guys are missing that Dany was a part of Drogon & when she died, that part of her was what killed the throne. It was as though she said enough's enough and was now at peace. It was metaphorical, not literal.The BIG PROBLEM with this episode was the pacing. It could easily have been made into 3-5 episodes instead of rushing through scenes. The writers ruined a good series, but people need to remember that GRRM devised this ending and GOT is ultimately his baby. We should all respect his wishes. I do, and I'll always remember this as the best TV show ever. But, secretly hate D&D for eternity, of course ;-)",8,20 May 2019,6,16
4768,"OK. OK. We get it, the episode -and the rest of this season for that matter- was highly underwhelming for our expectations. I don't disagree. In fact, season 7 wasn't all that great either. Now, I know it's trendy to hate on this episode BUT can we at least try to be critically objective?
I'm not rating the season as a whole here, nor am I rating the episode under the light of this season - it's only fair and it's not like there's any shortage of hating already.The key endings were fitting. Actually, I would argue that that's how the books are going to end as well, with few tweaks here and there but I'm mainly talking about Bran becoming king. But a number of things didn't make sense and a number of characters seemed out of place and character, e. g. Jon still barking ""She is our Queen"" and taking the side of our new Mad Queen even though she had just committed genocide...etc.This is where I have to address the rest of the season. Nobody would be rating this a 1 if this season and season 7 were erased and key endings were the same but at the end of a great season 10 that was proceeded by 3 better season that the writers took their time in them to layout a better transition to this ending, while still working on character development and seeing arcs to their end.You can argue against rushed transitions and weird character developments, but what do you have against the concluding endings?Jaime's redemption arc was flushed down the toilet? I think not. I mean, did I miss any killings of innocent lives he'd done while on his road to Cersei? Then, explain to me how exactly was his arc ruined? Loving someone, no matter who they are, and trying to save them from inevitable doom does NOT make you a bad person! Especially if they're having your child.Tyrion was stupid? Agree. Falls under ""out of character"" and ""weird character developments"".Arya killing the Night King? It was foreshadowed since season 2 or something. But the killing happened way too early, shouldn't have been in one episode at all. We've been for the White Walkers for an eternity and they were done with in ONE EPISODE?! This is an example of ""rushed transitions"" though.Bran becoming King? If he wasn't going to become King, then why did they spend all that screen time on him and his journey to become the ""three-eyed-raven""? I suppose he could've turned out to be the Night King or something, but where would the logic in that be? I still think that Bran will have greater roles in the book. So I'll give one, or half a one because it was something rather than finding out that Bran was useless from all along.I could go on and on about this episode and season and count the flaws after the flaws, but I would sum it up and say that this season mainly had some structural echoes but they don't overwhelm the good sides enough to earn this episode a 1.",6,20 May 2019,6,16

An age of peace and prosperity, with the wheel broken and the lies torn asunder.

He'll steer the six kingdoms away from the perpetual destruction ""the wheel"" caused. ""Those who don't remember history are doomed to repeat it.""Arya fulfilled her desire (mentioned in season 6) to discover what was west of Westeros, she never was going to be a lady.Sansa rules the north as queen of an independent kingdom. She will bring honor and glory to House Stark.Tyrion as hand, to guide Bran through the labyrinth of ruling people as he seeks out redemption for his past mistakes.Sam grand master, Davos master of ships and good ole' Bronn Lord of the Reach and master of coin (his debut paid in full).Brienne serves as Lord Commander of the Kings guard. ""All I ever wanted was to fight for a lord I believed in."" She believes in King Bran the Broken. Love that she wrote down all of Jaime's great deeds.

Well in this last episode I found much of it a fitting ending, while there was much talk of breaking the wheel, which ostensibly happened in an unexpected way, one thing you can't escape is that almost every arc will meet at its beginning.
Characters we thought would be rewarded couldn't escape the responsibility for their actions and consequences of their choices.The wheel is broken and a new one takes its place, similar on the surface, but different. That's the best way I can put it.There were a few somewhat cheesy moments, bit of comic relief that was goofy but in character but ultimately I think the show ended well, not fully satisfying or rewarding perhaps but satisfying Game of Thrones has never been. It's always played with our expectations, shocked and angered us, it was never a fairy tale nor did it end like one.

They literally changed the wheel, and that's the only way to stop history from repeating itself, otherwise we would end up with a never-ending game of thrones. Of course there would be plot holes in a show that has this many major characters and story lines. I personally really enjoyed the ending,. It was very emotional, bittersweet and obviously the most logical way for the story to end. Also, you can totally see the LotR analogy in the ending. I will never understand the low rating and whining about the writing of this finale. If the story would have been shown in a few more seasons, people would still be whining about how they should have ended the show earlier, like it happened with many other shows. If the show would have ended how people thought it would have, they would still complain about it being predictable. Get over it! If you have better ideas, write them down, make your own show. There is no ONE way how a show should, or should not end.",10,20 May 2019,14,49

4805,"I actually enjoyed this series finale. We saw the signs over the years, we saw Dany's faith when she went to the house of the undying and we knew she would never sit on the iron throne. I love Dany and I was rooting for her but in the land of GoT, we know we don't get the fairy tale ending. I love that the Starks came out as the winners at the end. Sansa gets her North, Arya gets to be the explorer with her needle, Bran is the king, and Jon goes back to his Ghost and his Wildling folk.

4807,I loved the way this episode played out. With all the criticism this series has faced I think Twitter etc would have imploded if the final episode had been a war with Jon killing Daenerys and becoming king...Everything that happened surprised me (in true GOT fashion!) and it all worked perfectly. It's tough to end or continue a series that's doing so well (TWD comes to mind) and I feel like it was executed perfectly.There has been SO much hate for D&D but I'm sure George R. R. Martin was heavily involved in the story! All the twists and turns including Daenerys' descent were befitting to his style and I think they've done a fantastic job!An excellent ending.A Game of Thrones fan.,10,20 May 2019,13,45

4810,"Game of Thrones spent multiple seasons with various characters spending weeks on end wandering from one place to the next. Each episode had a little bit of character development and some gradual development of multiple storylines every week. Fans had to wait a long time for the final season, and justifiably felt aggrieved at the rushed tying up of all the major plotlines.I didn't mind who finally ended up on the throne, but there were way too many character inconsistencies, too many red herrings and too many unexplained plot points to make sense of the final season.It promised much but delivered 'just ok'.",4,24 May 2019,5,13
4811,"So after i have watched the eight season, i'm wondering why the seventh season was not the last with 13 episodes ?",1,22 May 2019,5,13
4813,"OK! NOw before I review this episode, let me tell you how much I LOVE this show. I have loved this show since I started binigng Season 1-4 around Halloween in 2014. I was about 17 years old and tat the time, I didn't watch that many mature TV shows or movies. I was only watching the PG to 12 rated stuff. IU had just finished watching Attack on Titan being horrified and entertained by it, thinking that know other show could match or even supass that anime. Thats when I decided to give Game of Thrones a watch because I herd soooo many people online talking about it and praising it to death. All my friends were in on it so I gave it wa watch thinking it was some crappy dungons and dragongs Lord of the Rings crap thing. But OH BOY was I wrong. The show is so much a grounded in reality show where not everything goes the way it does, but it makes sense in a logical stand point. From the first episode were Jamie pushes Bran of the tower, I was HOOKED. and I have loved alll the season and watched them over and over again.But then around the halfway point of season 6, something happeneded. I started to realize that the pacing and the wringing and direction of the show was starting to become a tad predicibale. Certain sotrylines became somewhat medioce, particually Dany's storyline in merren. I started to lose interest, but then we had GREAT episode like the door, battle of the B and that SMASHING series finale, winds of winter. I was HYPED for season 7. And this is where the show started to lose it's magic. The pacing and sorylines felt SOOO rushed that it confused me at times. Characters making stupid mistakes and jugdments like John going on an expediction to capture a white walker was so DUMB. But then the series finale of season 7 was great, so I was somewhat hyped for the finale. And it didntt disapoint. I LOVED the first 3 episode of season 8. They were considerbly better than most of season 7. But then episode 4, i wasn't as invested in the ewpisode and episode 5was like WOW. I didn't expect it and I may be the only person who thinks that it made sense. BUT! I wish they developed Dany's villian arc a little more.This season and the last should of had 10 episode. But the showrunners fell like they are in a rush to end it. Just let the audience soak in whats happening in stead of rushing it. THATS what made the first 6 seaosn amazing. This finale was GREAT and STRANGE, but not in a good way. I didn;t really like that they sent Jon back to the wall. It felt Tragically unsatisfying. That was the WORST part of the episode. It was like, we had years and years of build up, two seasons teasing he is a targarion and then it doesn't matter in the end. WOW!Everything else somewhat worked. I a mixed on Bran being the King, but IU feel like it mkes sense and I liekd Arya leaving and travelling. Sansa being the Queen of the North. Tyrion finding Jamie and Cersi. All so intense. But yea. I think I am going to read the books and wait for Goerooge RR Maetain to finish the last two, as I feel like his version will pace it better. This seaosn has also made me want to read the novels of popular tv shows and movies. I am about to read the Harry Potter books tommorow and I am cuirous on what they missed out and if its better or worse than the movies. Becausee I LOVE the movies. But yea.",6,20 May 2019,5,13

Still, some events in this episode don't feel true to certain characters. Obvious decisions seem hard for characters even though their older self would see the solutions relatively quickly. However, the ending feels right for the characters. These characters (except for one) all get endings that seem logical and earned.

The final outcome not only felt fairly decent, it also was plausible and made - given the situation - lots of sense.
People who are voting this episode down with 1's aren't doing the show any justice.Having said this I still hope that once after all the books will have been finished, someone will redo seasons 5-8 based on true GRRM writing.",8,20 May 2019,5,13

4818,"The finale of Game of Thrones was awesome. I could agree that this season has been quite a rush compared with the others, but still the finale has been the perfect lesson of politics and thinking twice the only possible solution to the saga from the perspective of George R.R Martin.
Jon Snow was the only one with the opportunity to kill Daenerys, but killing her sealed his fate as a non optimal candidate to the crown. Killing Daenerys was the obvious end since long time ago. From season 1 she has been advancing her tyrannical ideas and only the presence of good advisors stop them. Once the advisors disappeared she became her father. Death was the only solution.
Tyrion, by convincing the remaining lords and ladies of Westeros that Bran was the right choice, has become de facto the ruler of the six kingdoms with the help of his friends, creating a new system.
Sansa recovered an independent North and Arya her life of adventures.
Jon gets the best deal, being freed of the boring life of a King and getting freedom in the true north. And a dog. What else?

The Drogon scene? The speech from Tyrion? The scene finding Jaime and Cersei???? Brienne writing about Jaime???Nope, sorry but I think this was an outstanding episode at say the least.

everyone gets what they want and everyone that's alive now diserves to be so and westeros has been given a golden chance of redemption.
all in all i think they did a solid job on the last season, not as good as the other seasons yes but still worthy of love towards actors, directors and other people involved in making this epic series for us. MY WATCH HAS NOW ENDED.",8,20 May 2019,24,96

Not a GMartin fan and found the books unreadable after watching the teleplay version. After 73 episodes, yes it was all basic Hollywood scripting, the ""faces"" and the ""heels"". A few minor faces get killed off, Ned and Robb Stark in the early days to build up the story and tension. In the end the heels get their rewards, Joffrey, Ramsay, the Night King, Cersei and Dany in the ""twist"" at the end. A lot of folks seem to miss the overall plotting and thought this was something different. Even Jaime has to tell the viewer that actually he is a heel not a face. Very nice ending and wrap up.

Even though i can kind of agree that season 8 was one of the weaker, if not the weakesg got season, this show in it's whole is still perfect. And i i know that about 10% of the whole Game Of Thrones fanbase disagree. Cause that is about how many that actually hate it, and it is just a very unfortinete convenience that it happens to be most of the haters that go in and vote the show downAs the man who played grey worm recently said in an interview, it is extremly rude and extremly shocking how you who hate season 8 have reacted. Think of how much extremly hard work the people behind this show laid into season 8. Just to be hated on and just to get 10% of the fanbase to try to ruin the show for 90% of the others... Instead of being to critical on the show, maybe stop it now? We all watched it, have different opinions on it in the end, and that was bound to happen!We as fans do NOT own this show, and can't try to demand a remake of this! I can't even start on how extremly rude that is! The people who made Game Of Thrones had another creative thought than some of us and instead of just about wanting to kill them, you should respect them!Game Of Thrones is the best tv show i have ever seen from start to finish, alongside Breaking Bad and people will in the end change their opinions on the show in my opinion.

Just like Dany in the show . It was realistic . There is no true good and mercyfull King except for the ...three eyed raven of course who has no human desires...As for the other characters they realy had what they deserve depending in the way they were grown up and lived for ,Jon snow belonges to the North , the real North.Sansa was raised to be a queen.

4853,"First of all, I loved that we had a completion to this story. From reading GRRM's books which had so many characters and so many narrative threads, I wondered if he'd ever be able to pull it together into a conclusion of some sort (jury is still out on the books). But the series did pull this together into a great final season (to me at least) and fulfilled the character arc for most of the main characters.I loved the ending last week with Cersei as she watched King's Landing fall and of Jamie who had been mostly redeemed during the series but also doomed by his need to get back to Cersei and die with her. This week, I liked how Jon and Daenarys story ended, and how Jon even afterward was unsure if he had done the right thing.Daenarys decision was spelled out better this week, mostly by Tyrion, but also by Daenarys herself. And it gave a better context to her actions of destroying her enemies as a means to her belief in a greater good.I liked the 'after' scenes with Tyrion and the new council. Good open-ended sendoff for the Stark kids, and it was nice to see Jon in the North with Tormund and to see him reunited with Ghost.Parts of this season did seem rushed, but the acting was exceptional throughout. And it was a good mix of personal moments with some epic scenes. And I'm glad that we did get a conclusion that seems to bring the story full circle.Would love to read GRRM's version of all this, and I'm sure he's writing up a storm to get a new novel out any day now. Yeah, any day now...",9,20 May 2019,9,29

After that it went downhill all the way to subterranean. I have never before had the misfortune to be fed so much B ###sh## in my life (and I was in the British army for 24 years so I know it when i see it (just like Arya knows a killer lol)). This wrapping up of 8 seasons was so pathetic it was unpalatable and unbelievable. It truly was beyond a joke. One quick question, are unsullied omniscient? If not, how did they have a clue what happened to Dany seeing as Drogon removed the evidence and nobody saw it occur. No matter perhaps untrained Archmaester Samwell figured it out along with the other unknown members of the Tribunal (plus fat Vale knights who were completely conspicuous by their absence in the last 2 incredibly important episodes when a knight might have been useful). All in all the most terrible ending to a once classic series that now be be remembered for the absolute atrociousness of the diabolically bad conclusion. In fact there was no conclusion other than sickly pathetic meanderings.

4860,"Overall, I really did enjoy this finale, but once it ended I started realizing that this episode would've been more satisfying if we had maybe 2 to 4 more episodes. I think having 6 episodes this season was a major mistake. The lead up to Daenerys' death felt a bit rushed and unearned even if it was clearly bound to happen.I'm actually quite happy that Bran is king. He has wisdom and he's also very wise with his decisions. He's also able to think for the people rather than himself. Maybe we could've gotten more development into that with more episodes, but he is the king Westeros needs. Very satisfied with Sansa being Queen In The North, Arya sailing west which reminded of the scene where she was sailing to Braavos. Jon's fate is getting lots of hate, but I think it suits his character. He'd be miserable in King's Landing and as Tormund said ""You've got the real North"". The ending is truly bittersweet as George R.R. Martin promised us.Wow what a journey, I still can't believe it's over! I have to commend the whole team of Game of Thrones for bringing this show to life.

4866,"Ok. Yes. This is an unpopular opinion. But hear me out.The final episode is mainly the ending that George RR Martin intended, at least in where all the main characters end up. This was always going to be the story of the last episode. However, there is clearly an issue with season 8.Now, let's address the real issue of season 8, and there were definitely many. It started fine with the first two episodes building up to the Battle of Winterfell. The main issues of this episode was the constant plot armour of the main characters. I would have preferred if they made a believable survival story for the main characters who were meant to survive. Personally, I was fine with the Night King being defeated here, the white walkers and wights were only in 14 episodes of the entire show and never said a word - I don't see how they could be the main villain. Also, those Winterfell defence plans were unforgivable, I understand that the episode wanted to be a spectacle and have the dead seemingly win, but you need to show basic logic.Episode 4 and 5 is when the writing really broke down. And I fully agree with many of the comments here that the plot here was rushed (personally rated episode 5 a 5/10). My opinion is that The Long Night should have been a whole season and then the final season deals with Cersei. The transition of Daenerys to Mad Queen was too quick, and was not believable - the fault of poor writing and a rushed storyline. I am fine with Daenerys going Mad Queen but it should be earned and be a gradual process.This leads me to episode 6. I have given this particular episode 9 stars as this was always the ending that was going to happen because of GRRM's outline - and the ending of many characters made sense. The problem with this season was the pacing and how we got to Dany going Mad Queen, but I believe the final episode was always the end point and so was able to stick the landing.I hope we get a more detailed GOT ending with the books but I am personally satisfied with the final episode, despite my disappointment with (mainly) episode 3 for the plot armour/lack of strategic logic and episode 5 for the rushed transition of Daenerys.Finally, I would like to congratulate the GOT team for the amazing cinematography, acting and general production which was beautiful and sadly letdown by admittedly weak writing.",9,20 May 2019,7,21

4877,"As fan of Game of Thrones, I wanted an end which no one waiting for it, as in the previous seasons . This episode was exactly what I wanted. I mean, Dany wasn't the best choice for the throne because of her madness, which we watch it since the 6th episode of season 1 till the last episode. Jon doesn't want to be the king. Tyrion is the best person to be the hand of the king, not the king. Sansa is a good queen but she wanted the north to be an independent kingdom with her in the throne. I think the change of the government system was the best end that could have such a series, as Game of Thrones, that is full of moral lessons. And finally, something for everyone who say that Jon Snow go to the wall without reason, in the final episode Tyrion said that there is always a place for bastards and criminals. If that did not convince you, think about the Game of Thrones being played in a fantasy world that could be at risk at any time. I really want more series like Game of Thrones.",10,11 July 2019,10,34

4879,"In the true spirit of GoT, how this ending was taking place was not to be foreseen or expected in any way. Even if we knew that it was not to end the way episode 5 did, I could not imagine Westeros moving towards something looking like a democracy. The episode also had this great resemblance to the ending of Lord of the Rings where our happy ending doesn't necessary look the way we wanted it to, and doesn't necessary involve the persons we wished for.This season was rushed through indeed, and I wish they would have done at least a 10 episode full final season. But one can't say that they did not wrap up this story just perfectly. We now know that the moral story of A Song of Ice and Fire is not the war between good and evil, but how the lust for power is the true enemy and how the person who we thought would save us from the rule of tyranns got consumed by power and became one herself.Although this is not how I thought the series would end, I am very satisfied with it.",10,20 May 2019,10,34
4880,"A flawed, somewhat well-written, fairly predictable but very interesting and strong ending after the pivotal penultimate episode. The events here flow naturally (mostly) after the previous episode and the primary critical problems are due to that episode, not because of any inherent fatal flaws in this one. It is a mixed bag overall, with many fascinating and strong elements, some flaws, and the big shadow of the fatally-flawed previous episode.In my (unpopular) opinion, the show can be fixed and made a hundred times more powerful by simply re-writing and re-filming episode five (The Bells) alone. But that's most probably not going to happen. The rest of this season was quite strong despite some flaws and despite the hordes of disappointed 'fans'.The show broke in the previous episode, not only because of how it killed its own careful building of Daenerys's character, but, in my opinion, because of a general flaw of misanthropy throughout the show where characters were twisted around by the writers to fit a worldview of general fatalistic bestial behaviour, and characters were always destined to failure, death, bad choices or evil, no matter what they did in the past. The writers contradicted years of their own careful character building just in order to arrive at the desired conclusion, in line with their very low opinion of humanity. But I will not repeat what I wrote about the previous episode. My review for that episode is the critical one for the whole show and it both expands and demonstrates my thesis that I summarized in this paragraph in much more detail, whereas this review is merely to organize my thoughts about the finale.Of course the hordes of 'fans' are continuing to flood this site with ridiculous one star 'reviews' just because the show didn't go as they expected. These people have a very serious problem with separating their own fantasies and illogical expectations from the actual flaws or merits of each episode. The writers and cast of this show must be flabbergasted and heart-broken by their fickle, brainless and whining fan-base, especially after ten years of hard work.On to the specifics of this episode (spoilers):Daenerys's death by Snow was expected and powerfully heart-breaking. I just wish that the previous episode had been much more subtle and realistic about Daenerys's fatal personality flaws.Drogon's reaction to his mother's death was very strong and well handled as well. Don't forget that Snow is also a Targaryen, heir to the throne, and also rode the dragon, so Drogon's reaction (almost, but not quite burning Snow) is not necessarily illogical. I liked it.The burning of the throne, the symbol and cause of so much evil in Westeros, was a powerful scene.The fact that Grey Worm and the rest of the soldiers of Daenerys's army didn't instantly kill Snow does not make sense however. Nor does it feel right that they should step down and submit to the council so easily after the loss of their leader, especially since they were portrayed in the last episode as going along with Daenerys's brutal policies. These are the biggest flaws in this episode.Tyrion's finding of Jamie and Cersei in the rubble seemed a bit too convenient but the scene was strong nevertheless. The rest of his character development and final new position and outlook in this episode was all very very good.The humorous nod towards democracy as an impractical joke was a nice touch. I admit that the establishment of the council was a more realistic outcome. I liked it.Bran as new king was slightly strange but not unrealistic. He was obviously more objective and suitably less prone to human flaws than the rest (in line with the show's despicable viewpoint of humanity as evil). On the other hand he isn't exactly human anymore so what kind of leader would that make? A mixed bag of a development.Sansa seceding the North didn't seem necessary anymore so it was a little weird, but it made sense for the future.Arya becoming an explorer was very strange. One the one hand she took the lesson from Sandor to heart about not being obsessed with killing and revenge, and it fit with her anti-social character needing a strong and outgoing occupation, but it felt like it came out of nowhere. We didn't see this side of her before.In summary, a flawed episode, but there is a lot to like here as well. Altogether, this show qualifies as a staggeringly epic, dark and fascinating but flawed 70-hour fantasy movie. As mentioned, the primary problem that broke the show was in the previous episode. I wish there was a way to fix that. But I don't regret watching the whole thing at all and I still think it is a strong show.",7,20 May 2019,10,34

4892,"Game of Thrones officially ends its final season with its eighth episode, 'The Iron Throne'. It may have concluded the story arcs that have been going on for eight seasons straight, but it sure as heck have not concluded my feelings of disappointment for this episode, or should I call this a 'series finale'.Okay, I have to admit beforehand: the ending is bittersweet. Some moments were actually what we wanted, a reunion between Jon Snow and Ghost, his direwolf, and the death of Daenerys for some, but not quite in the way we expected for it to be.Daenerys and Jon Snow starts a kiss scene between the two, but it ends with Jon stabbing Daenerys, hence her abrupt death. This is not what we wanted at all, we wanted to see at least a torturous death for a character if not Cersei then Daenerys but both died mildly. GoT is widely known for its ultra violent scenes, but in the FINAL season we only got this?Daenerys' character arc's end is disappointing for me. Yes, we expected for her to die this episode but not just being stabbed by Jon and get flown away by Drogon right? Totally not what I expected at first. But then I expected some epic scenes to happen, but all were just dialogue-heavy about appointing the King. I know, its necessary, but they should have made it shorter.Overall, this is quite a disappointing series finale. Despite some moments that left a smile on my face, this deserves better.",6,20 May 2019,4,10
4893,"...and not just that, unlike with the books, there IS an actual ending!Problem of this episode was that it somehow had to get out of the mess the two episodes before had left it in due to their rushed, unbalanced approach and their clumsy writing. This was a feat nobody could get out of unscarred. Still, as far as the second half of this episode goes, I thought it managed to pull it off and gave us a feeling of closure.Of course, the council to elect a new king - featuring some long presumed dead characters from seven seasons before - was impossible to portray in just 15 minutes. It would have taken a whole season to really show the political intrigue necessary to reach the conclusion shown here. It would probably take half a book. But come on - Bran the Broken? Giving the power to the one who least desires it? Does this not - finally - sound like a plot outline given by the grand George R.R. Martin?The closer this episode came to its end, the more it felt like this was the ending given by the composer of the Song of Ice and Fire. Brienne - check. Sansa - check. Arya - check. Jon Snow - check. This all felt like it could be the ending Martin is struggling to reach for so many years now.Weiss and Benioff struggled to reach it at well. The way they reached the ending is the problem, not the ending by itself. They rushed it, and its their own fault that they decided to tell this extra-large story in just eight seasons. That is what - in my eyes - they are most to blame for. Did they do it out of stubborness or out of fear that they could not write a longer, more satisfying version? You decide.The story they told once they ran out of books was often lacking depth, was often too much ""in your face"", going for the shock moment instead of reaping the seeds that had been sown. They rushed to the ending, losing plot highlights and character moments as they ran. They did not have the patience to let this story go were it belonged, they forced it - and this is why in my eyes many story elements like size of the armies, powers of the dragons, motivations of the characters went out of proportion.That's a pity.Still, it is not fair to blame all this on this one, final installment of a still great series. People are giving this one out of ten, but the mistakes have been made earlier. As I went into this season with a feeling of dread worrying about the characters, it turned into a feeling of dread because of the bad, unbalanced, and I force the point again, rushed, rushed, terribly rushed writing. In this final episode. I got some kind of closure that will suffice for the time being. I was content with the final fate of most characters. Could it have been better? Certainly. But considering last weeks episode, it definitely could have been much worse. The only thing left now it waiting for the official version of the ending printed in a book. George R.R. Martin, long may he reign!",8,20 May 2019,12,43

4905,"This show was not meant to be a fairytale. Let me kindly reffer you towards watching Snow White, instead. Which is a great fairytale, so do not feel offended. Season 8 was rushed. And faulted. Basically just bad. The ending, however, was not. The show was about ideas, characters and the way the evolve or not. Prince Charming was not supposed to marry dragon queen Cinderella. Every single character ended up on the right path. Doubts about Varys, but I always did like the son of a b***h, so not being objective about that. Jon belongs in the North, NOT ruling, like he always wanted. Dany went on to becoming her father and the way we all ended up hating her is solid proof that her character was a solid built up. Jamie chose to die along side the woman he committed the worst atrocities for. Tyrion remains a really smart and loveable character, that has always been a sensitive, flawed and good man. Who just happened to quit sleeping around and drinking himself half to death. Bran is a perfect choice for a king. He grew into a strong, stable man, wanting peace and having the knowledge of the past, present and future to rule. And his sons will not be some monsters that will rule when he will die, as he will not be having kids. No one should be born a king and have absolute power. It is a good, realistic message. Season 8 was rushed. Horribly so. Ending was not spectacular. It was mature. This was not about having favorite characters. Tyrion was mine. Does that mean I should be mad he's not the king? Are you people giving 1 ratings for real?! It may not be a 10. No show is. But 1?! No cast, no soundtrack, no cinematography whatsoever? Nothing? Please go watch a soap opera. I'm sure you'll get your happy endings there. Did not love Bran. Didn't like him much either. In retrospective, he was the right choice. Not a 10. But 1? A general of 4?

It was always about the stark children and the end reflexes this. Some cheesy moments but I'm ok with that. I think the characters were true to themselves so I wasn't completely surprised. The ending was a little Lord of the Rings but again I'm fine with that. I understand people knocking a few points off for that.

That act broke the wheel Dany died for. Arya going west of Westeros was perfect. Would have liked to see Gendry do something important. Seeing Bron push for rebuilding brothels made you remember why we love his character. I loved Jon going back to the wall that made sense as a fitting punishment but was hoping for the show to end with some sign that the white walkers were still alive and well.

4940,"This season was rushed and because of that many characters seemed to me to be out of character at times but the ending made sense, was bittersweet, and I was really happy with it",10,20 May 2019,14,54
4941,"Loved the finale. I was one who didn't have a huge problem with Dany's heel turn last episode so this one was a great conclusion. I do wish the season had been longer and I agree that the Lord's counsel could have been an entire episode on it's own.I would have like to have seen an ending with the last shot being a corpse laying in the north somewhere and it opens it's eyes and they area bright blue. End of series. that never would have happened but a man can dream, right?And of all the Starks, Sansa scares me the most. She seemed the most power hungry and I fear she will become another Littlefinger and grow more arrogant, especially with no one, that we know anyway, around to keep her in check.But thanks to HBO and D&D for bringing this great fantasy show to life and doing a wonderful job with it. As we have seen, it's not easy to bring any kind of fantasy to screen in a quality way, but these guys knocked it out of the park.I remember back in the begining I had never heard of a Song of Ice and Fire but saw the first trailer on HBO that involved the WW and this medieval soldier running for his life. I was hooked. I watched the first 9 episodes but when they executed Ned Stark, I was in shock. I had learned the series was based on a series of books, so I did a quick Google to see if the books had killed off Ned. of course, George had done just that. As soon as season one was over, I bought the entire set of books and read them all straight through. I still think book 3 was one of the best books I have ever read.And so our watch has ended. It wasn't always perfect and I didn't always agree with the creative choices made by the showrunners, but I am thankful I got to watch this epic fantasy series brought to spectacular life.",10,20 May 2019,11,40

4943,"This final season has been a perfect example of how terrible of writers D&D actually are, they saw their chance to do Star Wars and rushed the final season of a once perfect show, leaving it feeling awful and rushed, Jon was a Targaryen, for no reason, so many plots left abandoned and left alone, to give a pointless and ridiculous ending to what 7 season of perfection, thanks to GRRM's great source material have suddenly amounted to, i can't wait to see what they do with Star Wars, so the world can truly see what terrible writers they are",2,20 May 2019,9,31
4944,"So, the series ended on a mixed note for some. Many complain of the ending.. 'It did not go the way fans wanted it to go'. You can not pander to everyone or it doesn't become the show it was meant to be.
SO WHAT, that's life!
Question, why did it not go the ways fans wanted it to go? If it was that way it would be bad story telling.
The thing is it worked, get over it!
The series had to end shorter than it should have done.
The point is, it did surprise us all, how it was written, even I did not accept it, but as you keep thinking about it, you learn to accept it and understand!Showing that the public hated the ending shows that it created a reaction! It's better than Nothing at all.",10,21 May 2019,15,59

4964,"So Dumb&Dumber, went for the UNEXPECTED, shocking, jaw dropping ending... And it was as unexpected as a bad meal served at an expensive restaurant, after waiting 2 hours for the food to arrive.
The writing in this season takes me back to my college days when I had an exam and in the last 10 minutes I start writing a rushed, stockpiled frantic gibberish that has no correlation to what I have written beforehand. But they had literally YEARS to plan this.
Lets say I can understand the Mad Queen story, although I DO NOT, I think I speak for many people when I say that I feel like I know Daenerys better then I know most people in my life and she would've died for the commoners, but the way they written the rest of it, with Bran (that ""why do you think i'm here?"" pathetic), Jon (the one true warrior and the best person to rule the kingdoms, he died protecting the people, what he did is the greatness that motivate us to envision into our world after watching super hero movies) and Grey Worm (with the ""you cannot speak you are a prisoner"" then he lets him talk for 5 minutes and the ""Jon Snow is our prisoner he has to answer to his crime"", PUHlease! Grey Worm loved Daenerys, he would've killed Jon IMMEDIATELY, not wait for someone else to come and pass the sentance. Pathetically disgusting.
The only satisfying scene in this episode is when Sansa is named Queen in the North and when Jon pets Ghost.
I will never in my entire life watch anything written, directed or TOUCHED by D.B. Weiss and David Benioff.",1,20 May 2019,3,7

Everyone has had a perfect ending to their story.

The outcome of the final episodes are right and ends the story the way things should be, not rose tinted.If they wrote it how people wanted it to end, it would be judged as boring and predictable. I can't believe people can't watch and absorb the story for what it is and for what it actually means in the grand scheme of things rather than down-rate a fitting end to an excellent story.",10,22 May 2019,19,80

They end it well 😍",10,20 May 2019,44,215
4984,"I don't think the ending deserves as much hatred as fans are spewing at it. I do think that the whole season was mediocre enough that it made the ending seem better than it actually was. I at least felt like it ended in a way that didn't leave cliffhangers and didn't create any new questions. The problem is that this entire season left so many plot points unresolved, and I think it was unrealistic to expect them to tie all those loose ends in one episode. The biggest mistake was rushing this season; however, based on what they gave us and how much they had already lowered my expectations going into the finale, I actually felt okay after finishing it.Benioff and Weiss aren't awful writers. They wrote the first 7 seasons too, and those were brilliant. Granted, they had GRRM books to base them on, but they did change some things, alter some characters, and make the story their own in some ways. Not to mention, they were the ones who went to GRRM with their idea for the show. Without Benioff and Weiss, the show may never have taken off in the first place. The situation they faced would be like if they wrote the scripts for the Harry Potter movies but JK Rowling never wrote Deathly Hallows, so they had to tie all of the loose ends together without guidance from the books. For first-time writers of a series this monumental, that's a tall task, and while they obviously could have done it much better, the fact that people are spewing this degree of hatred at them is frustrating for me as a fellow GoT fan.Thanks to the cast, crew, directors, writers, and especially GRRM, for taking us on an incredible journey.And now, our watch has ended.",8,21 May 2019,7,23
4985,I really don't understand all the hate that this episode gets. I liked the ending. It shows the queen going mad just like her father. The queen never really understood what defeat is. She never really got it. Everything was destruction with here. She went to Westeros to take it from them without ever having step foot on it. The people there didn't want here ruling the kingdoms. She ruled with fear. The Lannisters died in each others arms. Sansa got what she wanted. To be an independent north and rule over it. Arya isn't a lady she loves adventure so that is what she is doing. Yes that Bran becomes the king was unexpected. But it kinda makes sense. He knows everything and doesn't really get influenced by others. He knows from mistakes that other have made in the past and will not make them again. It was a surprise for me but it makes sense to me if I think about it. John never want's to be king and will not be king. He is a leader and finds more in the north than in Kings Landing.Everyone was terrified at Daenerys only Grey Worm follows here. She lost everyone when she attacked the city. The vision she had came true. But probably not the future she expected. John killing Daenerys is just like the prophecy. So I thinks its fitting. I pretty much stand by the entire episode. Every ending made sense to me.,6,20 May 2019,7,23
4986,"Game of Thrones has always been amazing, since it began till its end. People is sad about this and if they did not understand the end, it is because they have never understood the show.

4993,"The ending was what I'd hoped for, every character's story (the ones that are alive anyway) is finished in a satisfying way, but it also leaves just the right bit for the viewers to imagine.
What I didn't like (and it has got nothing to do with this episode specifically) is HOW we got here, the destination was great, but the trip was a bit shaky.
In my opinion, D&D should've done a season for the Night King, and then another season for the Mad Queen. If they had taken their time to let the characters develop then this ending would be better than what it is now.
I'm still going to leave the 10 star rating because I'm not judging the season, I'm judging this episode, and I think it really was, as GRRM said, a ""bittersweet"" goodbye to one of the best shows of, not only this generation, but all time.",10,20 May 2019,9,32

To all the haters..relax it is just entertainment..perhaps they should try to create a suitable ending to the series? Overall the Starks finished up well considering the pain and agony their family went through at the beginning of the series..good way to end it..Would have been preferred if Jon and Danny were both incinerated by Drogon after he stabbed her..much more dramatic and I dont think Drogon would have left that deed good unpunished!nuff said",8,20 May 2019,9,32

4999,"I am struggling to understand the power of negativity levelled at the end of this stunning series. Perhaps it is hard for people to disconnect the disappointment with having lost a huge part of their lives (which I completely sympathise with) from the content of the plot.As so many seem, albeit worryingly, to believe that Westeros and Essos are real places, let's pretend they are. Would an ending with Jon or Daenerys or Sansa or Arya on the throne actually have been realistic given the circumstances? If anything, the 'big' moments along the way (Daenerys arriving north of the wall JUST as Jon's party were about to be killed, Jon returning from death, Arya jumping from nowhere to kill the Night King), though spectacular, uplifting TV moments, risked making the show less credible. The ending does precisely the opposite. This was not a fairytale, and, as such, it does not require an appertaining ending. Why did Daenerys 'suddenly' go mad? Because power and heartbreak corrupt and break people. Why did Jon do what he did at the end? Because he was the ever-honest, ever-self-sacrificial man of honour, and he remained as such to the end. There are perfectly rational and reasonable explanations - indeed, I would say the most rational and reasonable explanations - for all that happens. As for the 'speed' of the ending, well, once all the chips are down and cards on the table, I've rarely known people to take hours to show their hands.Congratulations to the writers, directors and production team for not being drawn into the trap of letting fantasy run away with credibility.",10,7 August 2019,15,61
5000,"I don't understand all of the people that are complaining about this season. Yes I understand everything feels a little bit rushed because it has only 6 episodes, but how do you think the writers felt that they had to end the whole story in only 6 episodes they didn't choose to end it with so little HBO did. And still I think they did a great job, everyone complaining about season 8 that the story lines don't match up with everything I'm wondering what 7 seasons you have watched?? Everyone got angry over the fact that Jon didn't say goodbye to ghost while in fact he always knew he would return back to the north because that's where he belongs he never wanted to rule, he never wanted the power and in this final we got to see them reunite soo all the angry comments were for nothing. All the people that are angry with the fact they turned dany so evil that they had to murder her because she turned into a mad queen... Why are you angry about this they have been building up to this since season 2 where she said she would take what's hers with fire and blood and that she would burn cities to the ground, kill everyone that wouldn't bend the knee... I know everyone was expecting it would be her or Jon because it build up to that for 8 seasons so everyone was expecting that but I'm kinda Glad it didn't turn out to be that way I like it that it had a twist with no iron throne, dany met her death because she was hungry for power and forgot what it was all about: to create a better world... And Jon always said he didn't want to rule or be king so it is a fitting ending..I'm happy with this ending it was beautiful and the characters got a great ending that they all wanted or saw coming (bran). This couldn't have ended more perfectly I mean what did you expect still bloodshed and Jon or dany ending on the throne... Im happy that this was the ending because no one expected it only a few.. And they ended it how it should : with the Starks because it also started with them and all along the seasons if you paid attention it was always about the Starks they had the most powerful stories yet to be told and now there watch has ended.Couldn't have done it any better!

5004,"So on to the last season, firstly the hate GOT has gotten for their last season is disgraceful. Im not sure people know how much work they have put in to make the 8th season. Recommend people to watch the documentary, «The last watch» on HBO to get some understanding. (example: for the «long night» episode they are 55 nights outside filming).On to the season talk and negative parts: they had some flaws with its rushed tempo and lack of answering questions about NK and some characters development (Jamie), and reasons behind their quotes (Bran). If season 7 and 8 had been 10 episodes we would have much more explanaitons and that would have been better. I heard that HBO said that they would let D&D get more time to work with, but D&D refused, that is of course a reason to be frustrated, so am I. But hey, whats happend has happend. Beside all of that, this is spectacular TV. The visuals, cinematography, set designers and especially music by Ramin Djawadi is Oscar worthy. My fav episode is ep 3, it is just breathtaking to watch a battle scene for 120 minutes, and its epic drama reach hights that top some of the best scenes in GOT history.The story and acting is also pretty good if you ask me. So on to the last episode which have gotten the most hate. Jon kill Daeny, I didn't see that coming, but what was so wrong about it? Daeny destroyed half Kings Landing and turned mad, she could not rule. When that has been said Daeny should have gotten more time to transform from good to bad. To the king choice. Remember the very first episode of season 1? Their main characters is Bran and also the first chapter in the book is Bran, he has a very big role in this story, and should have gotten more screen time and should have been explained better the last seasons, but even so he is never mentioned. Arya and Sansa play also important roles in first season, the Stark children and their journeys have been a crucial part to the story, so that they rule in the end is very understandable. Bran started the first episode last ending by getting thrown out of the tower, he ends last season by getting king ( OK, he is mostly Three eyed raven). Full circle. Surely people could not imagine a happy ever after ending with Daeny and Jon on the throne? The thing that really makes me mad is that 1.5 million people have signed up on internet to reacrate the last season. People have so high exceptations, no matter the ending people would have been angry. I don't think GRRM would make SO much difference in how it would end up, but let's see what his books ends with.To sum up, you are allowed to criticize if you didnt like the ending, but if you just think over how good the series is on every aspect, from start in 2011 to the end in 2019 we have to be grateful for how amazing this is. For me it will be the best show for all time.",10,15 June 2019,10,37

The Starks, The pack of Wolves is divided but are much stronger than they ever were, and most of the characters which we rooted from their beginning had ended well, ofcourse not everyone. Yes the ending could be much better but not that bad",7,24 July 2020,5,15
5017,"I see too many reviews saying the actors did their best and blah blah blah. I say no. They have common sense. They can see the mutilation of their own characters in the scripts. As far as in concerned they too had the moral responsiblity to make sure the story was good. Anyone with an IQ over 38 could see the dumpster fire that would ensue, refuse to be portrayed until they fix the broken mess. Seriously. They cant recast by this point, and if they did it would surely fail already from that alone. Therefore if the actors weren't such lazy turds and didn't accept the demise of their characters, we may have actually got a good season 8, even if it took an extra year.

And then be chosen as the new King and go marry Sansa. Or talk Dany out of her ideas of massmurder and fly away with her on Drogon.If someone would have told me by season 4 or 5 that I wouldn't bother at all who lived or died in the end, I would never have believed it. I sat on the end of the chair holding my breath when Tyrion was on trial after Joffreys death. I almost forgot to breathe during the sequence leading up to the destruction of Baelors Sept. But, all due to this worthless season, I was now just bored all over and didn't care one second if Tyrion and all of the Starks had gone out for good. It is by far the worst development of any story I have ever followed.I would really want to hear poor Peter Dinklages true opinion of all the stupid lines he had to say in this stupid finale of this ultimate stupid season - Peter Dinklage who has been so superb and, not that long ago, made me and so many feel so much for the Imp.",1,21 May 2019,5,15

5040,"The finale episode was by far the most anticipated episode in the series and the most over-hyped and long-expected conclusion of a series overall.The problem is that exactly because it was so long-expected that fans have created so many theories around the plot, some of which fell outrageously far from the real ending. So no wonder why it was doomed to fail and disappoint everyone outright.Everything in the episode would have made perfect sense under the right circumstances. There was just no time. So many plot lines finished, so many unearned plot moments because of the little time in which the writers had to further the plot, they were forced to put character development aside which in turn was the main reason why nothing made any sense in the end. Jon killing Dany was supposed to be both tragic and necessary, but it was so rushed and forced that the audience didn't get it in the end. Neither their relationship was developed much nor the madness inside Dany's mind made much sense the moment it exploded. It was indeed being foreshadowed through all those years, but it wasn't built correctly in the end. On the other hand, Bran's election was necessary, or rather it should have been if the audience would be shown his value as a wise, omniscient character, but in the end his involvement in the plot was very little. Maybe he would have more time to ""prove"" himself to us if there were more episodes in this season.So, in other words, it was a potentially fine culmination of all those 8 seasons, with plot points that made perfect sense in their raw form, but due to the small number of episodes (oh god why were they so few???) there was no room for the necessary character development and therefore the right foundations for it. And sadly without foundations it eventually crumbled under its own weight...",5,20 May 2019,4,11

5043,"It may not have been the ending fans had hoped for, or the 'bittersweet' taste George RR Martin described may have left viewers wanting more-wanting their own ending. It will be criticised for being rushed, a waste of eight seasons, a lack of satisfactory character conclusions; but game of thrones has been a rollercoaster of emotions for 8 seasons and nothing will ever come close to replicating the sheer brilliance of the show.Some will hate that Jon took the black, but it mirrors the character's arc perfectly. A man who never wanted power, who always did what honour demanded-what he believed to be right. He guarded the realms of men with his life, gave that life and then gave his freedom to protect that realm. Many would have wanted him to be on the throne, but the last Targaryen served the realm, and will guard the realms of men once again. He never sought power, it was always given to him. It may be a little wasted that more didn't become of his true parentage, but he would have made Ned proud, he did what he believed to be right.The mother of dragons, and all her many titles finally got what she craved. She was a powerful, inspirational character who went from a young Dothraki bride to the queen of the seven kingdoms. Some feel it a betrayal of her arc, but she achieved her goal, however like everyone else who sought power, that power consumed her. She inspired freedom and liberation, and truly was a breaker of chains. Although her loss was too great to recover from and she went to extremes for the throne, it is once again fitting that her legacy ensured her goal was achieved; she broke the wheel. Valar Morgulis Khalisie.The imp, half man, dwarf, one of the most superbly written characters on television. He made audiences laugh, weep, quote him left right and centre, and he showed the world what he truly was-a good man. His arc defiantly will be well received by fans, having been many's favourite character since the pilot, and his wisdom and conversations in dark rooms ensured the unity of the seven kingdoms. The last Lannister, perceived as a monster, will atone for his sins and live as a good man- a satisfying end.Bran the broken- as Tyrion said he had been on quiet the journey. The knowledge the character possesses makes him a fine king. Yes, hardly any would have wanted him on the throne, but the character abandoned his desires and childish dreams and became the man the kingdom needed him to be. There's ambiguity as to whether he knew all along, the show never fully explored his powers(one criticism I do have), but there is no fairer ruler in the seven kingdoms.Sansa and Arya- two incredibly strong female characters in different respects. They have both had incredible arcs and both, I believe, had fitting ends to their stories. Sansa began as a character many despised, but as the character matured, she became a true queen. The character faced more misery than most, and she did not let the actions of evil men define her. She was not subordinate, and she played the game of thrones perfectly. And no one, the MVP of season 8. Arya Stark always rejected the patriarchal expectations for women, and she became one of the most fearsome fighters in the seven kingdoms. She stared at death in the face, and said not today. Although her ending may be one that is very ambiguous, and very unexpected as the character never expressed the desire to explore, she had a beautiful end to an incredible journey.The stark children did their father proud, and the conclusions to their stories was beautifully done.This is just six characters, and I could probably write endless essays on their character developments. But the ending to game of thrones may not have been what fans wanted, and they will criticise, but it wove together 73+ hours of television and was a cinematic masterpiece. I have loved every second of the show, and although it wasn't perfect and some things could have been better, the show will leave behind a legacy that will never be forgotten.And now our watch has ended.",8,20 May 2019,9,33

5046,"The quality of an episode will often be affected by previous and subsequent episodes.In all fairness, this episode had an almost impossible task due to the preceding episodes, and I think the low score to some extent reflects the disappointment over these.This review is then as much for season 8.The main problem for me was not necessarily the story and the events, it was more the sometimes silly execution of some important scenes.Episode 2 was the only really good episode, with an evocative build-up to upcoming dramatic events; it could have been a classic if not let down by the following episodes.Episode 3 had greatness in store with its fantastic music and some claustrophobic scenes, but it was too much plot armour and spectacular, but stupid action scenes.I'm not a writer/director, but I'm sure it would have been possible to avoid the attack on WW looking like a suicide mission.Exciting fight scenes could have taken place without making the main characters survive situations with a guaranteed fatal outcome,
And finally it should have been possible to let Arya kill NK without setting a combined world record in high and long jump.In the last episodes, it could certainly have been possible to show the encounter between Danerys and Cersei (the most evil woman in the universe) in a different setting than the latter being in possession of superior forces/weapons without taking advantage of them.Danerys turning mad could have been shown in a more elegant way than with an on/off-switch.And the fight between Jamie and Euron could have been replaced with something more interesting, like Euron being abducted by aliens.I liked the scene where Hound made Arya abandoning revenge against Cersei, but it would still be nice to have an encounter between them.So with a little better execution of those scenes, S8 could at least have been a decent season, but with only 6 episodes, it could never have been great.",4,7 May 2021,2,4

After that scene i felt i need to puke watching the rest of characters left alive in this garbage...and choosing a king...someone that sent Theon Greyjoy to death in vain...someone that didn t do a *** thing entire season 8...NOTHING...I also felt i need to puke reading how the actor, who plays Bran Stark in the show, said about the petition for reamking season 8 that is absurd and ridiculousHow stupid is John Snow in season 8...?!

Again what do we learn from this? That people that did not put their life in danger stay alive ... and those that risk ..lose everything..a dangerous conclusion i d say...If i d be producer of this garbage i'd show my excuses to thousands of people that had enough knowledge and could and put effort to register on imdb just to express their disgust...

5049,"A disappointing end to an otherwise brilliant series. This whole season felt rushed and lacked the storytelling depth we came to expect from the other seasons. Yes, there were some great scenes, great moments, but the whole thing ended on a whimper with some glaring missed opportunities.* Jamie and Cersei's demise is very anticlimactic indeed, but Tyrion's grief and Brienne's scene with the book were touching.* Dany's turn to the dark side was fine by my reckoning - I always felt she would do so - and the destruction of King's Landing was awesome. I did not like the way her demise was handled. Too soft. Too many missed opportunities. She should have been screaming 'burn them all' and for her last dragon to refuse to do so because it bonded with Jon.* The sudden forward move to a few weeks after Dany's death left too many questions. Why didn't the Dothraki and Unsullied go on a vengeful rampage? Why didn't they kill Jon straight away?* How did Arya and Sandor get there first? Clegane-bowl was kind of OK, but a bit too silly (especially the Mountain's zombieness). It needed a sentient, mindful Mountain to give Sandor's revenge any meaning, not a stupified lump of meat.* Why did the Arya face-change story evolve for so long only for her to not use those skills once?* The election of a king (Bran FFS) was stupid and like watching a meeting at work. They should have argued more, then dissolved the 7 Kingdoms. Nobody wins.* And, for that matter, what did Bran do during the Long Night? What was his warging about?* New small council scene was fine. Glad Tyrion ended up doing what he does best.* Sansa's and Arya's send-offs were fine.* Jon's return to the wall was fine, but would have been better if Bran had imparted some sort of ""The threat isn't over"" message to make it more meaningful.

5051,"Did the producers/editors mix up all the footage from the entire season and just put it back together last-minute? Throwing any scene into any episode? There were some fantastic scenes throughout this series which should have been left for the finale..Having said that, I can't give it a lower mark than this because I sat through the whole episode.I get some stories endings are better left to the audience's imagination but rarely have I believed that I could write a better ending of my own!For such an historically violent show, the episodes that preceded the finale gave us some hope of a big showdown between at least two of the remaining big characters. Instead we get another treatment of anti-climatic build-up and a less than exciting conclusion. Surely the Cleganebowl would have been more fitting in this episode??What was the point of the white walkers other than the most drawn-out and expensive side-story ever!
Why waste time developing characters so intensely to give them no involvement in the outcome of the story (Gendry - Greyworm - Bronn)I'm not a writer so I guess my opinion isn't that worthy of consideration.

5058,"....but was it just because I fell asleep? (5.5*)First things first. As a devoted hater of what Benioff and Weiss have done from season 5 on, I have to say that the ratings I see for these last 3 episodes are unfair - and the knowledge all this disappointment comes largely from but*hurt Daenerists feels me with both joy and anger. You sow Dany+Jon LFE and fan pampering, you reap whining over the one thing you did right, D&D.Now, as for this ending to the show, it was...an ending. Did it provide closure? Yes. Was it satisfying? The best I can say is it was not ""Lost"".As the episode begins, Hitlaerys' troops are still murdering people. Grey Worm sure went full Nazi real quick. Tyrion goes into the rubble to discover the bodies of his siblings, in what was easily the highlight of the episode (enough to ignore how unnatural this collapse of an underground tunnel seemed, when the building above seems to be standing).
Afterwards, Tyrion resigns, and Hitlaerys has him arrested for letting Jaime go, right after she informs her armies of her intention to go full Murica, and liberate the hell out of everybody.
Both Tyrion and Arya tell Jon that you know, she seems to have gone bananas and is a crazy butcher, but Jon has a hard time accepting it. Side note, one wonders why Arya doesn't put Dany in her list - she can easily kill just about anyone at the whim of a bad script, and considering she can change faces (""Arya kind of forgot she can do that"") , she could even do it without it being stupid. But anyway, Arya doesn't give a damn, despite the previous episode. Jon meets with Dany in the throne room, and kills her without pomp or much of a climax - not necessarily a bad thing. I do so very much wish she had sat at the Iron Throne and cut herself like her father used to do, but that's too much of a detail to ask from show runners who can barely remember what they showed one season before.A few weeks later, the lords and ladies come to King's Landing to discuss with Grey Worm who holds Tyrion and Jon prisoners. Note how the guy who was executing people in the streets is much more reasonable now that they killed his beloved queen. Also note that Drogon took Dany's body and flew away, so technically they can't know what happened, who killed her or that she even died - but Jon Snow probably told them because Jon Snow.This council, representing all the great houses (what's Sam Tarly doing there? filling in for Highgarden? What about Brienne? Then again, Dorne is there to be shamed one last time in the show) decides to make Bran king for a reason we'd be better off forgetting. Bran decides the fate of Grey Worm's two prized prisoners. Tyrion will be Hand of the King, and Jon sent to the still active, for whatever reason, Night's Watch. Grey Worm is in some unfathomable way happy with this arrangement and takes the Unsullied to Naath (where they should all die, if you've read A world of Ice and Fire, but that's another story). Presumably, the Dothraki also leave, because we didn't think of another ending for them, and frankly, who really cares. Amazingly, Sansa demands the independence of the North before accepting her own brother as king, and no one objects. Yara was all like ""I actually liked Daenerys"" two seconds ago, but she never says ""hey, if she gets her own kingdom, I want the Iron Islands independent too"".More incredible is that even though the Unsullied leave King's Landing the very next day, no one says ""ok, Jon, you don't actually have to do that, you can go wherever you want"".And in the end, Sansa becomes queen, Arya sails west (whatever) and Jon presumably goes with the wildlings to be King beyond the wall. Everyone wins?The way the various surviving story lines ended was...decent, for the most part. Was it rushed? Yes. Was the 8th season an abysmal failure? Not quite - the ending of the 4th (gods, what a stupid ending), and the whole 5th, 6th (always apart from ""the Door"") and 7th season were abysmal failures. The 8th season had one truly hideous episode, but the end was not so bad - at least we got rid of Daenerys.Of course, one day George will finish the books, and this will all look that much worse.",6,20 May 2019,2,4

5119,"Before this review I rated 3 episodes this season, including a 10 tep 2 and 3. I had zero lighting issues and I could believe show-GoT setting Arya as AA since this is not the books.) ep 5 and 6 broke that. I have a good score to ep 5, because it wasn't as bad as portrayed by its current score. The ""big twist"" of mad queen Dany ruined it because as they say it wasn't earned. It was a sudden switch to a completely different alternate dimension of show-GoT.This finale was an abomination that turned the kind of reviewer described above. And to those who say it's idiotic to give a bad review ""hey it was perfect"" ""you're brainless"" and whatever else is said here: I'm really sorry you can't see you've been taken for a fool. So D&D goes Star Wars and has to rid itself of the most successful tv show. How? Hey let's just quickly ruin it. Spend that HBO budget on senseless crap. This is the result.So here's my review.One plus star for effects, lighting, production design
One plus star to the actors, especially Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington, who carried most of the senseless scripts. I couldn't help but wonder if Kit was in pain saying the silliest lines ever, but he tried to give them meaning even if there wasn't any.
One more plus star for the person who realised that Jon has to let poor one-eared Ghost.
One minus star for last minute setup of ""Bran the Broken"" trying to portray some scheme - it's so hard to decipher in the rush that it's a ""scheme"" but yea it's there. ""I'm not Brandon stark anymore I'm the three eyed raven."" ""I cannot be lord of anything I'm the three eyed raven now."" ""I will go now."" Then he goes and wargs birds above the battle WATCHING. Not doing anything. Then when NK arrives and still nothing else, gives poor Theon a push into death - spending time. Then Arya arrives with the dagger he gave her. And here we go we have, ""Why do you think I came all this far?"" (Else than being THE KING) (and who else I warged into besides Hodor... and hey, I screwed up my beloved brother so much he killed the woman he loved. Because I was adamant ""he has to know the truth."") and it continues shamelessly. ""You were exactly where you were supposed to be."" (Killing your queen ensuring you can't take your rightful inheritance, which I also made sure of sending you back to that frozen hell.) ""I'm sure it will."" (Improve how you idiots swear oaths to me since I am the darn king and finally I can be arrogant.) chaos is a ladder. I guess we are supposed to see that Bran learned it but he's also an idiot.One minus star for the north going independent. So much for a wise king Tyrion, your latest decision tops all your idiotic ideas lately. First thing he does is making sure of wars to come by allowing Sansa easily to defy and separate the north from the seven kingdoms - right in front of those who could've done the same but did not in trust, albeit they were promised the same (Yara? By Dany in front of Tyrion)One minus star for Edmure Tully. The guy was supposed to grow up when we last saw him talking to Jamie. He's reduced to a bigger idiot then when we first saw him.One minus star to the whole - we can't pardon Jon the rightful heir for savings is from a tyrant but hey, this all started with such things as pardons for Jaime Lannister for killing the mad king and even Sandor Clegane for raping and murdering children.One minus star to directing. For the 10 seconds of half headed Jon Snow just before the victory speech. Did your hands froze and couldn't move the camera? The stupidest shot ever, amateurs do better.One more minus star for writing. They kinda speak like five year olds before they kill I suppose because Jon Snows last line before the deed makes one laugh, honestly, ""now and always"". There were good lines. There were way more of idiocy. Bran the three eyed raven goes to his council, asks for a master of whispers. Hahhhh. Only worries about where the dragon went before ""I will go now."" Peace out. Good choice what a good and responsible king he's showing himself to be for the good of his new people.One minus star for: that small council. Shared with Ser Bronn - let's be idiotic it worked before - of the Blackwater inserted as master of coin. What a joke. Sam Tarly isn't a Maester. Ok he had no chains as I recall but still. The argument of brothels and all of them talking about themselves as if they talked of someone else. Topping with the honeycomb and the jackass - at least could've been finished, for the third time he started it. I guess there's no punchline anyway, at this point in the episode one would not have a hearty laugh but more of a ""for ****s sake shut up and end this misery.""I could take more minus stars, but I gave three plus ones. I do think it deserves a one star review, when measured with episodes such as The Rains of Castamere, The Winds of Winter and Baelor. I do think D&D deserves months of backlash, and a legal battle for defamation or something of the like. And I do think GoT deserves a remake of seasons 7 and 8 at proper length and true to characters and storyline established IN THE SHOW. I never thought Dany will get to sit on the darn throne, but this? I was hoping Jon becomes king yes, simply because he's the one who was absolutely required for them to survive. Arya killed NK (for some reason... I'm 50/50 now) but without Jon, they all would've ended as brainless blue eyed walking corpses. If there's anything to take away is that ruthless dismissal of this fact and discarding of the whole story. Even when reasoning that he didn't want it - he would've taken it, the character of S1-6 would've, for duty and for justice and for knowing this way he can stand for the people and his beloved north - when saying he's gone in the end to the only place he could find peace, it rings hollow. All it says is, here's the last chance to break the wheel, the last Targaryen as well as the last person who could never be corrupted, the only candidate for a good and wise and strong king - and the idiots just chose a different version of what was before.",3,22 May 2019,0,0

5121,"Well creators cornered themselves and nothing than that was expexted, but It was a faint hope...Unrealistic and lamebrain - that's what it was. Arcs of characters ruined once again, plots buried.1. Dany - freed people on East, saved humanity on West, sacrificed 2 childrens, army and almost her dream, snapped in the last battle (illogical and didn't make sense btw but OK) - and everyone judge her but forgetting about deeds of Lannisters in Castamere f.e.
2. Jon - couldn't kill Ygritte but betrayed Dany multiple times and killed her: demotivated her before Long Night, let loose of this demotivator to Dany's antagonists for no reason, turned his back on Dany before King's Landing battle, and than killed her in cold blood. Completely out of character... at least he could kill himself (because after all that he had no place in the ending) or suddenly became mad too and join her.
3. Bran - forsaw everything and did nothing, that was the plan. Pure EVIL.
4. Sansa - betrayed Jon but he'll forgive of course) Building a new foundaion for the new wheel of wars by demanding independance.
5. Tyrion - proposing to kill the only leader who can hold down Dothraki hordes and Unsullied (and a Dragon) after the new war was declared.
6. Dothraki and Unsullied - hordes emerged from nowhere and they won't do anything to anyone for killing their goddess they won't wage promised war or plounder the county and just flee... And Grey Worm will just gaze) and keep prisoners and let them elect a new king alongside with some clown-lords without real power and army.
7. Arya - just walking around since ep3. No faceless stuff at all (like taking shape of Missandei and killing Worm, then taking shape of Worm etc).In GOT we had complex characters with good and bad features so you can't tell who is who, in S8 allmost all characters became dumb and/or nasty villains or clowns.

5123,I have said many times GoT is the best show I've ever seen but season 8 was a utter disaster and the finale a joke. Its as if the 2 writers never watched the first 7 seasons. I know they can so better since season 6 and 7 were not awful and they have no books to go off from. They weren't great but still ep 10 season 6 is one of my favorite episodes but they destroyed the shows legacy and killed the characters. I've seen the all the episodes at least 3 times and it was a perfect show so destroying three last season is very frustrating. I've never been upset at a shows ending before but this was a different show. Now I have to say breaking bad returns as the best show from start to finish. I think the actors and crew wetter outstanding throughout so all my frustration is aimed at the 2 show runners. They really were lazy and considering they won the lottery by simply coping and pasting the dialog for 5 seasons they they could have at least tried to finish it well. Such a waste,1,22 May 2019,0,0

5128,"I am a firm believer that the ending of the episode has been planned from the beginning. But the entire season leading up to it was poorly executed.

5129,"First of all, I would like to add a comment about all the negativity the last episodes have received. I believe it is totally unearned for such a show, and even though it didn't end in a coherent way, GoT, as a whole, will be for a very long time, far better, by the 99% of the other series around.Secondly, before I start my opinion about the last episode, I would like to mention that I am one of those who loved the episodes 1-4, and I even liked episode 5, even though it was rushed as f*ck. There were some things that bothered me (for example the way they revealed Jon Snow's identity to the other characters), but I enjoyed the series so much that I was more than willing to forget about them.About the last episode: I believe you have heard that the scripts of the last 3 episodes leaked, after episode 4 aired. I was trying to stay away from them, but after Ep. 5 aired, I couldn't hold myself. I found them, read them, and confirmed that anything mentioned for ep. 4&5 was spot on. So that would mean that the script for the 6th episode would be legit, right?
Thing is, that after reading the 6th episode's script, at first I was shocked, at how disappointing it was, but a few moments later I was so happy, because I honestly, and truly believed that it was FAKE! The writers had mentioned that they would spread fake scripts, in order to deal with other possible leaks. Also the script was so utterly disconnected with anything that we have seen so far, that it couldn't be true.
I had just watched Arya, who was trying to escape the massacre in King's Landing, and I had just seen her in a killing mood in the last trailer, and in the script she was barely mentioned. That was my first hint.
Then I remembered seeing the exact words Varys wrote, to inform other lords about Jon's identity, and it played absolutely no part in the leaked script. So the script HAD TO BE FAKE!
Furthermore, Bran as king? Two episodes earlier, Bran was saying ""he couldn't be lord of anything"".
And Jon in the Night's Watch? As punishment????? Punishment for what? For killing the person who slaughtered thousands of people? In the same show where another major GoT character killed his king, who was *saying* he'd burn them all. And he was never punished for that.
I was emotionally prepared, for watching a massive GoT ending, and I was so excited at how the production tried (and managed in my mind then) to mislead people.And then....I watched the episode. The episode which had even more plot holes than the ones I spotted in the leaked scripts. Bran appears as someone who had been planning this all along. Jon has been turned into someone who can't disagree with his now-officially-lunatic girlfriend. And he only decides to do something, not because of justice, but because he realizes that his sisters won't be safe. Arya goes to King's Landing after the long night, only to do absolutely nothing.
This was disappointing.
I thought there was plenty of room to have a great ending. I was expecting another battle - Jon against Dany. We saw in ep 5, Jon commanding his army to go back - that could be treason wouldn't it?. Also, I believe the Dornish army would appear (they probably were informed by Varys, about Jon and they'd come to his aid). I was even hoping for a scene where Jon would be captured, Dany would try to execute him, but Drogon would refuse burning him since he was a Targaryen. And somewhere then, Dany would get killed by either Jon or Arya. Arya, who I was certain she'd be in a killing spree after ep.5, and I would even bet money that she'd kill Greyworm. For the throne I was expecting it to be destroyed, but I expected to see Jon as king. You know, Jon Snow? The person who had claim to be king, who was raised in the North, and had already united with the wildings?? The only character who could unite the whole Westeros, instead of dividing it even more. And then bring democracy, I don't care! That would have a good touch. Let Sansa be Lady of Winterfell, Bran become a massive archmeister, Arya go west, and Jon find his bestest boi of a dog he had!Anyway, to sum up. The last episode, messed it up. I loved the fact, that in GoT, whoever wanted the throne for him/herself ends up dead. Did the ending have to be so bad, in order to achieve that? If the writers couldn't find a way to sum things up after episode 5, they should have hired a few fans and let them brainstorm. Or they should have left the series in autopilot, after season 7. Just pick the easiest way to move things forward. A predictive ending would be far better than the ending we got.My rating is 6/10. I feel like I should give a lower rate, but honestly I can't. It's GoT we are talking about. This has been one of the greatest shows I've seen, and I don't think we'll see soon such a series. I'll definitely watch the spin-offs, but it won't be the same.",6,21 May 2019,0,0
5130,"Unless you're a super hardcore, GoT fanatic who reads all the books, this ending isn't bad enough to ruin the rest of the series. Many hated all of season 8, I'm not that extreme. Episode 1&2 I can live with. Episode 3 itself was fantastic. Regardless of how someone feels about the story, if they tell you the storyline implications ruin the action cinematics and tone of the episode they're lying to themselves or you. I defended this show coming all the way into episode 6. But this episode, WAS BAD. The wrap up was lazy; the writers' creativity died somewhere along the line. The actors did fantastic (considering the script they were given), the production and visuals were 10/10 as always. The music was perfect. But the story was so bad compared to every other episode of the series it may give you nightmares. I suggest doing what I'm doing, and forever pretending this series ended with the battle of winterfell.",3,21 May 2019,0,0
5133,"First I'm sorry for the actors who did their best for the show. We appreciate you for trying and being honest with what you think of this season as well ( spoiler alert : they belched and hated it. Just YT their reactions.) Second, GRRM didn't finish the book, understandable however, D & D (Producers who killed GOT who are and will kill the new star wars series as well ) were told of the ending. They were also offered 2 more seaons, more funding by HBO to properly do this series justice, yet they refused and said they can do it in 6 episodes because they now have a contract with Disney. must be alot of mmmoney to ruin their reputation :). Third, ALOT of plot holes, ALOT of thing missing, ALOT of useless screen time. D&D Kinda forgot they were doing GOT.Here are some unanswered plot:
-Why did lord of the light matter? Who? What? Prophecy?
-Azor Ahai
-Jon as Targaryen never
-Varys notes and letter
-Horn of winter
-Unsullied to Naarth?
-Dothraki? They were resurrected?
-Why was Jon captured instead of killed? unsullied now perform democratic powers? Didn't they just kill everyone in kings landing since they were all under cercei?
-Cercei + Jaimie died by 5 pieces of bricks?
-bronn scene? Whats the point?
-Why did they choose Arya to kill NK? To not meet people expectations? Also she ran past the entire kings guard and a ton of NK army right infront to jump and back stab?
-Bran king? Why? Master of stories?
-Lord meeting, Jon never brought up
-Why was tyrion speaking when greyworm just angrily said he can't talk but proceeds to let him?
-What was the point of Arya Assassin skills? Just to kill the Frays?
-WHERE IS THE GREAT WHITE HORSE OF PROPHECY?
-No point of the wall, what's the point of Nights Watch? Didn't realize anyone survived the night's watch.
-That one lady with bran?
-How did the starks and tyrion and company survive the crypt of death?
-How did they know the mad queen was killed by Jon? Where was the interaction? Kind of important you think?
Scoprion ballistas nerfed to the ground.-Did Euron grow scales and fins to swim that far fromm his ships to KL?
-Mad queen transitioned too quick. Not enough build up. not enough of anythign actually in this season.
-Jon useless? He keeps saying she's my queen even knowing she's going everything against his own morals. Where was the conflict?
-KL fixed and ashes gone in 3 weeks? Who worked on it? The tired unsullied and dothraki who were cornered by the 7 lords? Where's their food supply for 3 weeks?
Point is, NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE. This was clearly a 2 more season show. No matter how you look at it, the disrespect these 2 did to their fans, to GRRM, and actors was not right. The only reason GOT got this far was because fans supported the franchise, great actors, and GRRM holding their hands. This season did not do it justice no matter what anyone said.To the new Star wars Series set in 2021 or 2022, may the force be with you and hopefully not D & D.

Why was he sent to the wall when there's no more threat? I mean, the night king is gone and they're no longer fighting the wildlings. I know Bran sent him there to stop a war with the unsullied but they got on their ships and sailed away from Kings Landing... Also, let's build on his true heritage, make him kill Dany to save thousands, if not millions, from getting burned alive only for the unsullied to capture him and eventually make Bran king??? Furthermore, how did the unsullied even capture him? Dany was carried away by Drogon to somewhere unknown so, technically, they wouldn't have noticed she was gone or even dead unless he told them which, again, would have been ridiculous.Now let's get to Bran aka the three eyed raven -
Am I missing something here?! All he did throughout season 8 was warg into a bunch of ravens and make it known to everyone that he's now the three eyed raven and doesn't want the title of Lord, then all of a sudden turns up at KL and tells them he only came because they would ask him to be king?!?!?!?!? Ay?!?! So now he can see into the future with no explanation whatsoever...Unsullied -
How are there so many? Didn't the majority of them die at Winterfell?Dothraki -
Again, they literally all died at Winterfell, then all of a sudden there are hundreds of them left... and where did they go after Dany was killed?I could go on and on but I suppose it doesn't change anything.

How the hell did Grey Worm keep him prisoner until the lords of westeros arrived? I thought he's all about executing people on the spot?

Don't we deserve to see how Jon told everyone that he killed Dany?
How did Tyrion so conveniently find his siblings? Uncrushed and with full make up on? I thought the entire basement crashed on their heads?
What's up with Bran saying he wants to find Drogon? If he could do that all along, why didn't he prevent the mass genocide of all those innocent people? Or ever warg into him in episode 3?

I feel empty in the way that I've wasted so much time and emotion on something I've cherished for so long, just for it all to be a huge disappointment.I've left the anger state, I'm now in an empty grief.I would like to say thank you to everyone involved in Game of Thrones who aren't Dan and Dave. Everyone behind the scenes working their butts off and all the actors have been so great. I still love you all. My problem is with the writing of this epic story.I will stick to this episode. First, what was the point with all the build up with Jon's heritage if it didn't have any importance what so ever in the end? The true heir is now exiled to the Nights Watch for killing a mass murderer. And what is the point with the Nights Watch now when the Night King and his army is gone and when there's peace and friendship with the wildlings? It has no longer any mission. And why do they care what Greyworm think? He and the Unsullied were apparently leaving Westeros anyway. The Unsullied is less than 4000 men strong and the Dothraki light cavalry will be less efficient behind the ""walls"" of Kings Landing. And it's pretty easy to starve them out if necessary or force them out to be slaughtered by the remaining forces of Westeros. But after all Jon has done, no one defends him. What a waste.Second, why creating a new political system that is so poorly created that it will just turn into more wars further down the line? It will just be a matter of time before someone will question Norths independence and demand independence for themselves or demand the North to bend the knee. If not under Brans reign it will happened after him. And why do they believe choosing a ruler will be a peaceful matter after Bran is dead? What happens if the lords of Westeros can't decide on who rules next? Well, war will happen of course. Talk about breaking the wheel...Thirdly, Bran has been so passive since he became the Third eyed raven. He has massive powers and knowledge but it is regarded as something not important to focus on. He is supposed to be wise as well and puts Bronn as Master of Coin. Is this a joke to Dan and Dave? That council was so ridiculous. I could rant on forever but what's the point now?The biggest show in history has come to an end. And it is ruined to the point that it isn't even worth rewatching in the future.

Like you are having a really important and very long and strong conversation but suddenly ""you need to take a poo"", so you end it up as fast as you can (he goes there, she does that, she dies and so on) and you have to go.
And the scene where Arya is on the ship and looking towards bright future? Oh gosh, such a cliche! Inspired by titanic?! She could even ride a horse towards the sunset...

The ending with the characters all being shown going into their new lives, switching from one to the other.
Special effects were glorious. The music was everything it has been through out the series, epic.Dany had to die, her mental state has been pretty unstable through out the whole series and she obviously was not going to stop. Jon had to pay for killing her. And there clearly was a reason to bring Jon back, killing the biggest threath for the realms of men is a very valid reason, if you ask me. Jon returning to the real north with his direwolf was the bittersweet ending he and we all deserved.
There had to be a different way to choose a king/queen, otherwise the whole ""game for the throne"" would have had no meaning. They had to realise that the way things had been before was not going to work going forward.
Dany fullfilled her destiny, the wheel is broken.
Tyrion grew to become a man with a good crasp of the way life works, he learned about love, forgiveness, mistakes and loss.
Sansa deserved the north. Arya finally got to be who she is. There was no way to every one have a happy ending.

Here are just some of the things that made no sense:1) In a painfully long and drawn out scene, Tyrion just happens to find the remains of Jamie and Ceresi under like a single layer of bricks, despite an entire keep falling on top of them.2) We come to The Unsullied gleefully killing hostages and John meekly objects and then leaves. There's no way the John Snow of old would let this happen, he would have the Northerners fight the Unsullied here. But the John Snow of season 8 is an entirely different character to the previous 7.3) The entire mad Queen angle comes across as even more rushed as Dany is now basically Hitler.4) To continue the character assassination, John needed convincing that Dany burning women and children alive is evil.5) Dany's defeat is anticlimactic, a minute of conversation followed by a knife in the back.6) Drogon instead of incinerating the man who killed his mother, decides to arbitrarily burn down a chair and fly away, all sad and stuff.7) Greyworm instead of immediately executing the man who assassinated his Queen and the woman who freed him from slavery, jails him instead.8) The Lords decide to make a Bran king, based on his great story (yes it is that ridiculous). They also title him the broken, because the show runners secretly hate the disabled.9) I guess the writers just forgot about all the buildup to John being the rightful ruler. Since it isn't mentioned. Instead he is to be sent to the wall even though the Nights Watch is now utterly pointless.10) It's also massively out of character for none of the Starks or Tyrion to make his case. It's not like he saved the world or killed the woman he loved to prevent more atrocities like Kingslanding.11) The North secedes from the 7 kingdoms and in a totally realistic portrayal nobody objects or cares. I mean are we really supposed to believe that the Iron Islanders and Dornish happily accept being ruled by Bran even though the North isn't.12) We get a small council meeting, Bron cashes in on sweet fan service and gets 1 billion titles and made master of coin. Tyrion is also now hand of the king because reasons. The show doesn't really give one, so just make up your own.The good:

I started to watch GoT years ago and now its ended. All episodes were amazing. I saw many angry reviews on youtube but I couldnt understand why so many reviewers so angry on episode 3/4/5. Yes, there were bad decisions but I could take it easily.
But after episode 6.... Even I was like ""what the hell was thet?""
You know... How can you expect something serious after you see how Jon Snow says to Grey Worm that he is going to speak with the queen and leave Grey Warm behind cutting throats. But! Five minutes (!!!!!!!) later Jon came to the Red Keep and see Grey Worm already standing there. And its like 20 minutes after episode started. So what can you expect later? NOTHING GOOD.
Daenerys was betrayed by everyone! Just everyone betrayed her... And she was so happy seeng Jon like an old friend. And Jon killed her... He couldnt even kill her first love few seasons back...
But who cares anyway?! The throne should be his anyway. He is the king. He son of Raigar. So what right do they have to judge him?
Why they even listen prisoner who betrayed his queen?
Why everyone vote for Bran if some of them not even know who he is? Seriously you came from Dorn and you are like ""Hmmmmm first time in my life I see this guy.... Ok I will vote for him... Wait what his name? Bram? Brah?"".
Why Bron on the council? He will do anything to save his life and first person to change side...
Why Tyrion so shocked seeing burned streets and people if he wanted to see them burn? (season 4)
Wasnt Varis sent all these messages to all lords that Jon is Targaryen... But everyone looks like dont even know anything...
What was the matter of Jon being Targaryen?
Why Jon still doesnt know enything? Did he forget that he is Targaryen?
What with Targaryen anyway? They put seven kingdoms together and now only one Targaryen left. Isnt it a good time to separate?
What was it with Jon, Varis, Daenerys, Jorah? 8 seasons they tried so hard, and got so far but, in the end, it doesn't even matter.......

After waiting 2 long years (not very patiently I must add) I have been completely flabbergasted at how the directors have made such a diabolical job of not just the FINAL EPISODE of GoT but also the whole season 8. It almost makes me wonder if this is some sort of a horrible joke by the directors and HBO to cause such an uproar that another season 8 is made (crazy I know). For the white walkers to be built up for the past 7 seasons to be killed off in such a boring way is just disheartening.

5230,"A 5 for the first half of this episode. The makers of GoT did a pretty good job of screwing up the whole game plan here, BUT they have allowed themselves the possibility to fix all of that by making a sequel. The events in A Song of Ice and Fire have come full circle: we're back at the start with a lone Targaryen banished to a strange land with a strange people but with the potential to be chosen as a leader of those strange people AND with the potential friendship of a powerful dragon. Who knows, there might even be more than one dragon still out there for him to befriend. All we need now is for a new enemy, another power-hungry noble family like the Lannisters, to make an appearance and create the necessity for Jon to return to the Six Kingdoms in order to save it from ruin. Hence the 5 out of 10.Many of my predictions actually came true. Daenerys' plan indeed was to break the wheel by burning it, to burn the existing world in order to create a new one from the ashes. The only thing wrong with that plan? There's only so much you can rebuild when you burn EVERYTHING, someone just had to put some effort into trying to point this out to Dany! She still had the best of intentions, she hadn't gone completely mad! But obviously some men just don't know how to speak to women, so instead of speaking to them, they either quit their job as hand or they kill them in spite of claiming to love them.OK, well, murdering Dany was not only an immortal but also a risky move. But there is a certain logic to that strategy for Jon, and it doesn't necessarily interfere too much with the basic plot. Now that Dany has been taken out of the picture because of her overly violent ways (that are forming a problem in peace times), Jon can take over and continue in her name. But does he? No!The first obstacle to that problem is of course Drogon. It would make sense for him to kill the person who killed his mum. But he turns out to be either unaware of who the real culprit was, or intelligent enough to grasp the real reason why she died: the fight over that bloody metal chair. Gone it is! Nice symbolism in that move. OK, Jon, mount the dragon and preach an interesting story to the survivors now! Especially the army of Unsullied and Dothraki. But does he? No!Against all odds the Unsullied can be convinced to spare Tyrion and the surviving nobles and other powerful people sit together to choose a new king or queen. Because now that Dany is dead, surely there are really no more suitable candidates left? Sansa and Arya of course know better. For there is the perfect candidate for the job just sitting in a jail cell and as it so happens it's the very half-brother whose life they need a desperate excuse to save. But what do they do? Nothing! They don't say anything and allow another new king to be chosen: Bran. Where does this come from? No idea, I'm guessing Tyrion just went with whoever he thought wasn't too power-hungry and also inclined to spare both him and Jon. And instead of Bran the Builder of course this time they go with Bran the Broken. Nice touch, just the man to rebuild all of King's Landing...Then Jon's life is actually spared and his half-brother who doesn't really want to be king sits on the... well, in the wheelchair cause there is no more Iron Throne. But they continue with the kings though, there goes all the logic of the symbolic act of melting the Iron Throne. Only this new king is better than the rest because 1) a handful of nobles picked him on a whim 2) he doesn't want to be king 3) he can't have children. Gee, where did we hear all of those things before?Robert Baratheon never wanted to be king and was chosen by the Lannisters and the other nobles. And even if he could have children, he sure as hell never managed to obtain any legitimate heirs cause he never bothered visiting his wife's bedchambers, leaving that to her brother instead.
Daenerys then? She was chosen as a leader practically by any people she ever encountered, surely her claim is not only supported by a handful of nobles. Maybe she wants to be queen but she wants that power in order to break the wheel of oppression. She can't have children. But yeah, she's dead. So then the next best thing would be Jon. He doesn't want to be king. He gets chosen as a leader by the Night's Watch and to a certain extent the Wildlings, in a similar fashion to how Dany was chosen by the Dothraki and the freed slaves. The only down-side with him then is that he can have children. Doesn't mean that he will though. Because let's be honest: who could ever meet his expectations after he had to kill Dany? I'm guessing romance and fathering children isn't the first thing on his mind, at least not in the foreseeable future.
So of course they choose Bran...
I had no idea he even had any sort of claim, either through blood or through leadership abilities. Cause when did he ever display any qualities as a leader? That's right, never. He's the boy who sits quietly brooding in the corner and doesn't want anything to do with anything. He was the perfect candidate for the job of Maester, not King! But of course Sam already got that job, so it was taken. Three-Eyed Raven in and of itself is not enough of a job apparently, yet he didn't want to be Lord of Winterfell cause he was too busy being Three-Eyed Raven. But now he does want the job of King of not one but Six Kingdoms? To me that just makes no sense... I think Tyrion hit his head while moving those rocks around looking for Jaime and Cersei.So basically all Daenerys has ever done has only achieved overthrowing the Lannisters, at the cost of burning all of King's Landing and her own life. Then Jon gets not one (the Red Woman brings him back to life), not two (Drogon doesn't turn on him), but three (Grey Worm can be convinced to spare him) chances to finally step up and take action. He's the one and only true heir now, the last Targaryen. Ironically he even has the same name as the very first Targaryen to rule the Seven Kingdoms. He also got some new blood from the Starks to counteract the madness caused by inbreeding, cause he wouldn't have burned down King's Landing for example. He's the only one Drogon, the last dragon, still considers a friend or relative. All hopes are now focussed on Jon... So what does he do? He meekly rides off to a far-away land somewhere beyond the Wall where he can then do... What? Wait for death? Cause he really hasn't been doing enough of that? Destiny keeps on saving him, cause unlike him and the other characters it knows that he was meant to be King, so he can't die!Jon is just so passive for someone with all that destiny sticking to him! He allows everyone else to make the big decisions, he allows himself to be murdered, all in all we get the feeling that he constantly feels hopeless to change anything he sees happening around him, even if he would like to and is real quick to follow the orders of others even if they completely go against everything he personally believes (it only takes one suggestion of a hand on death row for him to turn on Dany after a conversation of about 3 sentences that apparently makes it clear to him that he will never be able to temper her fire, and of course the very idea of making himself King through marriage to the woman he loves never enters his head). But he's supposed to be the one true King, the Arthur of this story! My only hope is that like Arthur, he might return... Although there sure aren't any such predictions made at the end of that final episode.So in the end it's all up to you, author of the books and makers of the television series, to decide whether this is gonna be another truly GREAT series with a LAME ending that basically ruins the whole build-up... or if this is going to continue and be redeemed through Jon's future actions! Jon has the potential to be the next Daenerys, if only he could man up a little bit and actually do something for a change. ;-)Suggestion of a future plot along the lines of the first one:
Soon the Wildlings will declare Jon King Beyond the Wall, and who knows who else he might encounter on his future travels now that the threat of the White Walkers has been taken out, for all we know he might be able to rally a whole army from beyond the walls of the Seven Kingdoms. In the mean time there's plenty of time for a new villain to make an appearance at King's Landing and take the throne from Bran. Then possibly Jon could end up in one or other difficult situation fighting new enemies beyond the wall in his quest for an army (knowingly or not), at which his old friend Drogon shows up to rescue him, taking him on a ride to a far-away land where he can encounter yet another people who can end up following him. Fortunately for Jon, he also has quite a few friends left in the Seven Kingdoms, with his brother as King of the Six Kingdoms and his sister as Queen in the North. Who knows, maybe even Arya can help him, there's no telling what great advantages or new friends she might make overseas after all. Maybe she could even find Drogon a girlfriend to breed with, a possibility that was never presented to Dany. Yes, I see the potential for a great future there... So there's still hope! ;-)",5,20 May 2019,0,0

And the sad thing, I don't really care about it because I don't care about the main charakters anymore..After Seasons 1-4 (clear 10/10) I was heavily breathing every time a main charakter was in danger.. After Season 6 (Hodor twist - And the twist with the sept!!) the internet theories exploded - everything and every character seemd to have an awesome development and there seemd to be more unexpected surprises to blow our minds away). But then Season 7 starts and suddenly time teleportation is possible - Euron is the typical action-movie bad guy - Episode 5 and 6 are unlogical . But, the ending of season 7 was real GOT again, with Cersei tricking all the others - Jamie finally getting away from his sister - and Littlefingers death scene...After season 7, expectations were high again.. (how much hours I spent thinking and discussing about possible endings..):Denearys could have easily taken kings landing in season 7 episode 1 and the capital would have surrendered. But her army got smaller and smaller, Cersei, bought the golden company, had time for preperation .. Still, this had no impact on the story.
Jamie's development over 7 seasons had no impact on his final decisions..
What's the point about the Bronn story this season? Bran did nothing... (beside maybe he set a trap for the night king) - but the three eyed raven story had no impact, the night king had no impact on the overall story (most important characters survived and somehow a large part of Danys army survived).
Euron, a complete waste of a character.
And Jon.. reunited many armies for the long night, but his true identity and the mystery that was built around it.. All for nothing.The first half of this episode gave me really hope for a ""good"" ending of this mess that was built up the previous episodes.. But then once drogon had melted the iron throne (amazing scene!) it becomes ridiculous.. (Why are dothraki and unsullied waiting for weeks instead of directly reacting against the treasoners?)
It didn't seem right .. This is really worse than dexter..Why do I still give 5/10?The soundtrack from Ramin Djawadi is just amazing - his compositions for game of thrones are just perfect (10/10).
The cinematography is astonishing (Drogon - may be the best animated dragon in tv-history!) (10/10).

It was a sad scene and I didn't even shed a tear. I was so angry about it all and how it played. When Jorah died in ep 3 I was out of it couldn't control myself. And even when Sansa puts the stark pin on Theon that was it for my emotions. I am so f'ing mad that I couldn't be sad for Dany's death because how bad it played out. Drogon coming in, burning the Iron Throne... idk, wtf. Anyway, after that when he takes her and take off, I was hoping too much for a twist at the end of the episode, explanation below.Then, choosing the new ruler. WHAT THE ACTUAL F IN THE MF WORLD IS THIS MAKING SENSE? Yes, choosing someone, good alright it works. BUT WHY, no one mentioned Jon's lineage. How the F this become the biggest secret in the history of GoT and it's not even mentioned at the end!? I know Jon didn't want it and neither does Bran, but why the F no one say it? Why showing Varys in the last ep sending multiple messages about his lineage? Looks to me that everyone knows, so why not just consider it. Anyway, also Grey Worm, F you.Why sending Jon to the wall, why just why why why???? Dany's character was butchered this season but so is Jon's. This was just dumb, again, the word for this episode, dumb. All of the things regarding his lineage was just thrown in the thrash. It's so disrespectful for all the fan of the show why do Jon this dirty? Honestly, he should have been elected the King. That is one of the things that would have made that season redeemable (I have 3 propositions below).Now to the things I liked and that earned that episode 3 star. I was glad that they were able to move on and start rebuilding and show us that all the 6* kingdoms now, will be looked after, idk, you get my point. We are still left with some great houses you know. Tyrion lived, and he is the last Lannister. Their new council, it was good, it gives hope that the kingdom will be in good hands from now on. Sansa's ending was satisfying, with all of the things she endured, she at least got what she deserved. Rulling the north and having it as an independent kingdom like she wanted. She fought for it and she got it. Also I want to point out when she is getting her crown, she has no braids at all in her hair. That was good. Why? Because the entire show, she changed her hair to kinda copy the women she was learning from. From Cersei at first, then when she was around Dany, if you looked closely, her hairstyle resembles a lot like hers. Anyway, I thought that was a little detail that was well put. Arya's ending was excellent as well. I loved seeing her taking charge, going on that adventure, having her own ship with the Stark sigil - brilliant. Her character was not done dirty like some others.Why giving us ''I'll try to find him'' line if we're not going to see anything? F off Bran, go jump off a tower somewhere. I'll stop here with his non sense. Oh no never mind, Jon finally giving Ghost that good boy petting. F you. It's too late for that. Just F off D&D F offffff!!!! I wasn't having it at that point, I was so mad seeing Jon at the wall.There are 3 things left for this episode/season to redeem itself if at all possible in the future (just wishful thinking):1- Redo some of the scenes of the episodes (4, 5 and 6).
2- Just change some of the scenes of the 6th episode and make Jon the King.
3- Or, give us an extra scene of somewhere in Essos, of an unknown woman, covered under a hood, hiding her identity, with white hair. No need to see her face, maybe just one strand of hair coming off the hood, and bam, ending credits. She had red priestess followers in Essos and that would have made sense (not like it took much comparing what happened this season). Drogon brought her to Essos, maybe Mereen, she was found by a red priest, brought back to life, and lived in exile again, like she was at the beginning of the show.I never read the books, I have all 5, and I was waiting for the show to end to read them. I will, and I hope when the 6th and 7th book come out, this is different. I can't wrap my head around Bran is the King and Jon is sent to the wall. I'll burn my house down if that comes to it.*English is not my first language, please don't hate on my grammar. I did my best.",3,20 May 2019,0,0

5259,"First, I just want to mention that I've never been the greatest GOT fan. I havent read any of the books and I only know little about these prophecys and such. And STILL I was dissapointed in this season. And mine is a special case because it really hurt me for the following reason: I havent been following GOT for almost 3 years now. The last one I saw was season 6. The show had been fenomenal up until that point but I decided to take a brake because I kinda got bored watching too much at a time. So i didnt watch season 7. And I only watched it like a month ago before episode 2 of season 8 came out. I decided to hop back into watching the show for the final season. And season 8 hurt because of this. I remembered what it used to be like some years ago and I didnt feel that sensation now. I expected it around every corner but nothing. Literally nothing.And this episode was the icing on the cake. All the characters have lost meaning to me even before this episode.  It was like a change of roles. Nobody acted faithfully to their character. Thats when you realize that the appareance of the actors alone doesnt make them the character. Dont get me wrong the acting was spot on but in most cases the actors were given some bull.And the scene where they decided who was going to be the new king.... as if I was watching a kindergarten conversation. So dumb and soo forced and rushed just to be able to fit everything in one episode. I have some more problems I want to express but Im actually killing my braincells in the process so this will be enough.",4,20 May 2019,0,0

Why didn't anyone, including Bran, point out Jons right to rule? Why did he even bother to tell him he was Aegon Targaryen if he was plotting to assume the throne himself? STUPID LAZY WRITING! Clearly D&D have spent their time working on the new Star Wars movie rather than honouring their commitment to GOT. I hope fans boycott their movie, it flops and they are subsequently banished to the nights watch oblivion of the entertainment business! Plenty of time to reflect on their sins! It seemed like the perfect serving of breakfast in bed, but the rotten egg has left the worst stench imaginable and ruined the whole experience!

5264,"GOT was a series that taught it's fans to ""accept the unexpected,"" but the season's ending was a total byproduct of illogic plots and unintended focus on characters that were proved worthless at the end. The Queen who was promised to rule, the one who promised to leave the world a better place, almost got mad and started to think liberation of people as freeing them from materialistic life and John who proved he knew nothing had such a role through which we can concur that The three eyed raven(Bran The Broken) almost tricked Jon snow to be Aegon Targareyan so as to make him a threat perceptively to the mother of dragons And in that way he could be saved from being burnt to ashes by the dragon fire, and in the mean time Bran through his vision knew he would be the King of the 6 kingdoms anyway. Samuel Tarley(Sam Tarley) Who claimed to have read about Aegon Targareyan (lyanna Stark's & Rayegar Targareyan's true son) also seemed to be a conspiracy, as he was appointed as the arch maester of the 6 kingdoms, Tyrion as always has played a safe role and has saved his ass from being whipped since the ""trail by battle"" in the vayles until he was captured as a prisoner in kings landing
( after conspiring his queen by setting Jaimi free to meet Cersi). Despite him asking with Lord Varys knowing the fact about Aegon Targareyan, Tyrion betrayed Varys of knowing about Aegon Targareyan and he saved his ass. Later when in prisons of Kings Landing he infected Jon's loyalty to kill Dany(which Jon had to execute for very strong reasons). In this manner GOT succumbed. Proving no logic, many lose ends and through disappointing the fan base. Bran was claimed as the King by Tyrion( as always Tyrion knew he would be the king's Hand) and Sam spoke no word about his friend Jon as a rightful heir! Jon was sent back to knight's watch, this proves that Jon was resurrected only to make him realise that ""He knew Nothing.""

5269,"I don't think I've ever left a review before and I know it doesn't matter because the millions of people who adore this show like me agree with me unconditionally.Since episode 3 with that pointless ending of the night king I thought oh well obviously they'll pick it back up. After episode 4, with Rhaegal's wasted end and the failure of Jaime's character arc, I thought that Missandei's execution was great so I kept faith. Then, in Episode 5 with the complete obliteration of Game of Thrones most iconic character with Daenerys turning into the 'Mad Queen' and acting completely out of character like the WHOLE of the show had been developing her as the saviour. Not to mention they failed Cersei and Jaime. I still kept faith because I thought well, maybe, somehow they'll fix it. And you can't deny the visuals were astounding.Now, after watching the end to the biggest, best, most iconic show there's been. I'm speechless. Can I just say, despite everything, how boring, monotonous and depth-lacking that episode felt? Must be because dumb and dumber directed it. They killed the one character I didn't want to die, fair enough, it fitted with the terrible story you've developed the past few episodes. Then you make BRAN KING, you punish Jon for doing what you all wanted? You send him back to the Night's watch? Failing yet another character arc. So now it's Daenerys, Cersei, Jaime and Jon Snow that the show has thrown away 7 seasons worth of character development. The only character ending which felt satisfying was Sansa becoming Queen in the North.I feel like it's a joke like they're going to say of course that's not how it ends how stupid do you think we are?! but obviously that's not the case and they are just stupid. They decided to end it earlier because they thought it would begin to drag. They couldn't have been more wrong because nothing has felt more rushed than this season, and last season in some ways. This is truly going to go down in history. I never had a single thought in my mind that they would fail this show. None. I always thought it would be perfect, I knew that it would divide people and I knew that I might be shocked and the person I wanted might not get the throne.

5274,"This show wasn't prefect, no great show is. However, to have it totally butchered in the end by ""racing to the finish line"" makes me more sad than angry.The very first thing to really disappoint me personally during the final season was the battle at Winterfell and how it ended with no explanations. Forget the idiotic defensive strategy employed. It's the scenes of entire units of the combined armies totally destroyed that disappointed me the most. From the viewer's perspective, there was no army left. The next episodes show us an army as if nothing happened. No explanations, nothing to justify why all these soldiers exist despite what we saw at the end in Winterfell. Maybe not everyone was at Winterfell? Or we were not given the perspective of fleeing soldiers who totally ran off the battlefield? We don't know.The rest of the season was even worse. Forget about how the Night King's story ended. Every major character that we knew totally took a 180. From there, we get lots nonsense, and then the mad queen of ashes.

When the credits rolled by, I still could not believe that it was all over. Such a weak, lazy way from the writers to end the greatest show on tv. The cast and crew were amazing as always, even though they continued to have poorly written material to work with. I am so dissapointed, I cannot believe what a let down. Only thing remains now is to patiently wait for the books. Maybe they will deliver a complex, satisfactory and bittersweet ending to some of the most amazing characters out there.

5308,"I love Dany. One of my favourite characters. I thought her death was beautiful...even though I didn't' like it as such.So I offer you this theory. In my own mind it actually makes me OK with the ending.The writers (or GRRM) could have done anything with Dany's body. But they chose to have Drogon carry it away...East. Now in the East is Asshai and we know there's some red priestess there who could bring Dany back to life. Let's say this happens and then Drogon keeps heading East.It's not mention in the series, but it's a theory that if you keep going east past Asshai, the map loops around and you'll end up in the far North. Who is in the North right now? Jon Snow...In Dany's House of the Undying vision, after the Throne room section, she then sees beyond the wall and Drogo/their child. This seems like an odd choice of location - why not the Dothraki plains? Maybe it's a hint at what does come next for Dany.So I offer you that Jon and Dany might just one day, meet again and be free from all the politics of Westeros and be able to make as many incestuous babies as they like. There was certainly hints in Season 7 that both Jon and Dany would have children...this of course seems like it was a massive misdirect but perhaps...just perhaps they could live happily beyond the wall, both having been brought back to life.",7,20 May 2019,0,0

Different side plots build up during the course of 7 seasons, none of them was actually touched in the final season.You actually shattered the characters. Daenaerys was a people's person,literally opposite to the fact that she was nowhere close to the mad king. But in a fit she became one. The dialogues doesn't seem convincing. ""To make peace with Cercei I needed to destroy the King's Landing"". Tyrion justified that she flipped in the last episode and she has gone mad. Tyrion's character was deteriorated and 10% of it was saved in this episode.The true heir, Jon Snow is back to Nights watch and not even a single person raised the point of being him the true heir infront of the council. He was portrayed as a blind follower of Daeny.Arya. What he did in 6 episodes? Killed the night king in the 3rd ep and one nudity scene. What else? What happened with the woman with no face?The fact that she killed the the night king and then she went on killing cercei. What is wrong with this girl.Different stories built up during the whole 7 seasons were never used in the 8th one.Point is if you think of ending, Jon snow back to Night's watch,Sansa queen of winterfell,Arya going to West,bran king of 6 kingdoms(noone actually detested sansa's req).

This show has always been about characters making choices and the story changing along with those decisions. But the last two seasons have just been extremely different and disappointing. It seems like D&D just wrote down a check list of stuff they wanna put in this season and then sloppily put that stuff into each episode. The result being uncharacteristic lines, teleportation and over the top foreshadowing. On top of that, they have totally disregarded any realism within a fantasy story. This isn't Lord of the Rings - no hate just saying that this show is based on more realistic events and has elements based on historic events.

This wasn't GOT! This was some Disney ass crap that made no sense. Thanks for killing any hope of anyone ever rewatching this nonsense.

Couldn't have imagined Game of Thrones will end like this. 'Winter is coming' since season 1 episode 1 and Night king's arc ended terribly, why? because they are planning a prequel now. And that's why I'm blaming HBO too. White walkers story was started from the 1st season and so it had a very important role in the whole Game of Thrones series. You can't just make their story secondary. Night king was the biggest threat to the humankind, and they ended the story in just a single episode. Not just Night king's arc but the whole Game of Thrones story felt in rush. They surely needed more episodes. I think its all about money. Money is the only thing HBO cares about. They earned more than enough from the whole series and earning won't much differ for last season regardless of success or failure of this season. So, they just don't care how the series ends, viewers like it or hate it. But the prequel will have GOT brand name, multiple seasons and so the money too!

5338,"The principal difficulty in my mind is that when they ran out of GRR Martn's writing/plotting, Benioff and Weiss just weren't up to it. While they were within the realm of the books they had all the 'pointers' necessary to do a good job. Eliminating characters and plot points is normal, and while under the umbrella of the books' plotting, they did an admirable job, but once they got through the fence it just became, not bad, but pedestrian.Even the directing suffered. It went from close to brilliant to 'good' TV fare, which was far below the standards set in the first 5-6 seasons.B & W are good TV writers, but left to their own devices, they became so banal that almost anything they did in the series would pale from when they were 'in the sunlight' of the master.Their talking about just made it worse. It's as if they are trying (desperately) to justify their take on the series, knowing in advance they'd failed. They should have taken the high road and just shut up, cash the cheques, and go on the next thing. Art is art and needs no justification. The moment they spoke prior to the broadcast, the more desperate they appeared.The flaws are manifest. It's extremely difficult to 'wrap things up' correctly in the fans' eyes, and the harder they tried, the more they failed. Part of character development is that protagonists change and grow. Good become bad, bad becomes good, but even the characters internally 'learn' something. A good director lets us share in that development rather than write a series of exit lines. It was if they anticipated commercial breaks to make us forget what the last scene was about. One the better finales was MASH, and there were allowed a glimpse of how the 'saga' had changed the remaining characters. Yes, change they did, but still remained the characters we had loved. In GoT we just don't know. Everybody became a Marvel Universe depiction of their persona.I gave it 4 stars because it was very 'workmanlike.'It wasn't that it was fundamentally unsatisfying, it was that it was BORING.And to get this far and be bored is beyond dreadful.",4,20 May 2019,0,0

5344,"To sum up what the others are saying:1. We never had a problem with Mad Queen Daenerys. But all you did these 8 seasons were foreshadowing. Foreshadowing is not character development. Not convinced at the least that she would burn innocents after she clearly heard the bells. Our Dany would go for Cersei immediately, albeit some collateral damage could be inevitable since Cersei planned ahead of this and let civilians in (A COMPLETELY forgotten plot which to me could be the perfect reason to make her look like the Mad Queen to the civilians btw but smh nvm)2. We were used to brilliant storytelling from the beginning. That is the core and heart of the show, how the character's arc develop, intertwine and ""mess up"" with the others. This season was just absolutely horrendous, simple, arc-killing, nonsensical-dialogues trash.3. HBO offered you practically unlimited budget and the ability to extend the series but you said no. That shows how disconnected you are to the viewers who have been following the series religiously.4. Saddest part is, since the Battle of Winterfell i think most of us saw it coming.

5410,"Firstly. The positives. I just want to clarify that all 5 points given are for the cinematography and VFX teams that have truly done a phenomenal job and deserve so much better than this... There are marvelous scenes, especially the one with Dany with Drogon's wings behind her, truly beautiful. The acting is also fantastic with Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke in particular shining this season. Tryion's heart wrenching scenes with Jaime and after his death. The terrifying scenes with Dany completely mad, the look in her eyes as she is drunk with power, you never hear her say it but her body language says ""I am God."" all over... despite the awful way her character was written, which I will get into later on, I cannot help but give Emilia Clarke full credit for selling that madness so well, a stellar performance throughout the season.I'm afraid that was all the positives I found about this episode, and this whole season. From a writing perspective... this is catastrophically rushed... For the culmination of a show that has been built up for eight years, this truly breaks my heart to see one of the most incredible TV shows become the one thing it was against. The political aspect of the show that sparked its most well written conversations has been thrown out of the window, and fantasy tropes and cliches are embraced tightly as certain characters truly seems immune to dying, escaping impossible situations and always being saved at the last moment. Completely nonsensical writing such as the Scorpion's aim being either pinpoint accurate or Stormtrooper level accurate depending on what serves the plot at that moment. Arya somehow teleporting behind the Night King who is surrounded by his generals and it is revealed only a few scenes ago that the White Walkers are so sensitive they would react to so as much as a drop of blood hitting the floor. But worse than all that... is the unforgivable way they rushed through this whole season, things suddenly happen while everything between these things happening seems to be cut out. Such as Dany's descent into madness having basically no real buildup and going against her character since the beginning of the show. Or the constant 'teleporting' or the unforgivable way the entire White Walker threat was taken care of in one episode. It really destroys your emotional investment with the show... You feel their lack of care and you start losing interest too.It breaks my heart to say this about a show I once loved. But Game of Thrones is but a shadow of it's former self. What once felt like a truly interesting story that ignored the tropes being used in fantasy, spared no one, and had some of the most riveting conversations between our beloved characters, is now a cliche ridden, poorly written piece of eye candy.",5,20 May 2019,0,0

5416,"-At least Jon pet Ghost in this episode. There's 1 star.-I have to give credit to the stunt and CG teams, Drogon has always looked amazing and the setpieces were great. 1 star-Acting is still top notch for the most part although I could feel some distaste in some cases. Still 1star.And...that's it, 3 stars from me.Now...boi where do I start?
-Jon has a discussion with Tyrion. Jon still has the ""sHe iS mY qUeEn"" tape stuck on repeat. Tyrion tells Jon ""They don't have a choice, you do"". Jon is like ""You know what?!"". Jon goes to Dany where she delivers a borderline mad speech...she literally has a God complex in this episode. Her ""They don't get to choose"" line was so out of character that I almost shut off the episode. Now they come close together for a warm hug and a beautiful moment(in D&Ds minds'), ONLY for our expectations to be SUBVERTED AGAIN(or so they thought, because I was ""yelling"" at my screen ""Jon, take that friggin dagger and stab this psycho already""). It was so predictable.-Drogon: ""You want an Iron Throne? Syke...I'll melt it"". I will go as far as saying it was a symbol for ""breaking the wheel"", ending the rule of ""tyrants"" and putting a stop to the ""Game of Thrones"", but I think D&D thought it would be cool so they put that scene in.-In chains, brought for execution, Tyrion still is the most capable man to name a king and you know what, the Lords of Westeros agree. I don't mind that Bran's the king, but the way it was decided is kind of a letdown.-Yara doesn't seem to condemn Dany for burning King's Landing. Excuse me, what?-Where's Drogon? He was last spotted heading east, WHERE? It's the FINAL EPISODE of a show that revolved around dragons and we don't even get to see Drogon or know what he's been up to? I honestly expected him to fly up north and join Jon at least as he's the last Targaryen but no...-I'm glad Bronn got his castle but why is he a suitable choice for the Master of Coin? After everything that has been going on in the past episodes that is.-Arya turned into Dora the Explorer.It was disappointing, thank God it's over at least.",3,20 May 2019,0,0

5421,"Are you serious? This was absolutely the worst ending possible. The writers were right about one thing, I never expected it. Because I never thought they could make an ending and just ignore the other 7 seasons of back story and character developments.First they end one of the greatest dynasties the world has ever seen by killing of one and exiling the other. Jon/Aegon, Daenerys and house Targaryan deserved better. Rhaegar Targaryan who sacrifices so much deserved better.
They put all this mystery in the story of Jon's mother and then no one finds out? Nothing with all the prophecies of the Prince that was promised and lightbringer? That's just poor writing.Second, the cliché part of it. Dissolve the monarchy and make the people decide? Luckily they didn't go through with it, but just the suggestion of it in the show is bad enough. I mean it's the story of the 7 great noble houses. It's like Disney wrote it for them.Third, the choice of king. I MEAN COME ON! Bran Stark, the weird sociopathic cripple? I mean they suggest the whole season that Jon is the rightful heir and he would make the best ruler. And then they just pick Bran? Another example of poor writing. I mean Sam and Tyrion both wanted Jon to be king first and now they just cast him aside?And the ending of the Stark kids. I hated all the endings. Sansa Queen in The North? Yeah she finally got what she wanted since season 6, but I really don't like sansa as a ruler. An independant North? I mean her brother is king and now she decides to carve out her own kingdom? Yeah she really doesn't just want power.Then Arya's ending is the one I can understand at least. But still I would have preferred her to stay in westeros.Well yeah Jon's ending sucked. He deserved better. The last heir to the greatest house of Westeros to die up North. The last descendants of the legendary Dragon Lords of Valyria just dies of North? His parents Rhaegar, Ned, Lyanna sacrificed so much for him to die if like that?Then you have the endings of all the other main characters. It's like they tried to give everyone the typical the happy Disney ending.
Like brienne and podrick in the kingsguard? Tyrion back as hand.
Only ending I liked was that of bronn who finally got his damn castle!So yeah the writers really ruined the show. Just hope the books will be better",1,20 May 2019,0,0

5431,"Where to begin? Dany dies by Jon mere moments after he says he cannot betray his queen. He only does this because Tyrion talks him into it, but this was completely unnecessary because Jon saw first hand what she did in the previous episode, so why would he need any convincing? Now, I am fine with the dragon not killing Jon and instead burning the throne...sort of. I like how the dragon was smart enough to know what the cause of all this death and destruction was to begin with (the throne) but at the same time it didn't make sense he wouldn't try to burn Jon with it (which would have been cool because Jon could survive due to his Targaryen blood).Then the council scene. Grey Worm shouts at Tyrion, saying he is not allowed to speak, only to let him give a speech immediately afterward. That part was stupid, but not nearly as stupid as the prisoner changing the minds of the entire council and telling them who should rule. They all just listen like, oh yeah, okay we see your point. DUMB!!!Then we get 30 seconds of Tyrion pushing in chairs. Whatever. Maybe this was to see if anyone was still paying attention. Then the people come in to sit with the new Hand and Bron of all people gets elected master of coin, but then goes to talk about brothels. Seriously!? They try to throw in cringe worthy humor now!? What was the point of this scene?Then after all that, Jon heads north of the Wall to live with the free folk, I guess. That's the conclusion. Wow! Maybe he goes off to become a lumberjack like Dexter did in his finale.Weird thing is, I actually mostly enjoyed this season despite its glaring flaws, rushed story, and desimation of character arcs, but this finale was unforgivable and will go down as the worst season finale of all time.I apologize if there's any typos in my rant, because I did this review on my phone, and I don't want to edit the review because I cannot stomach to read anything about this episode right now, not even what I have written.

and his chains are melt and become lose, so he picks up a sword and runs towards deneriys and kills her.
there weren't many soldiers standing,
so he kept fighting them & tyrion helped him, at that moment the wildlings and soldiers from the north arrive to fight for jon snow and to kill deneriys army with arya stark on top of them, they arrive and kill some of deneriys army , At this moment arya goes toward jon snow and she picks up her sword and kills him ! .
she turns to her supposedly called army and BOM , she removes her mask and she is the waif ( the waif killed arya in season 6 and took her mask).
AND then a huge army bought by baelish from the golden company arrives (baelish is not dead.
i believe that he is one of the faceless & there are many clues the proves that & also i don't think baelish fell into a trap done by sansa lol).
Baelish kills everybody,
he also knew about the dragon so he brought a scorpion and kills it.
He manipulates sansa,he convinces her that jon had choosen to side with deneriys so he had to die & arya was dead already.
Baelish sits on the iron throne with his beloved sansa whom he forgives for what she did and gave her a second chance.(Baelish is the smartest game of thrones character and from the beginning of the show they try to show that.)

I cannot express enough how two 10 episode seasons would have been so much better than what we got. Maybe it wouldn't be on G.R.R.M's level but it would've been better than whatever we got.

Not to add cheesy ending of Deny with him flying with Dany in claws.Now this is where i got mad. You had most emotional characters, main characters in show, where one kills another and you gave it 3 minutes of time? And after it you just cut few weeks later. How did even Grey Worm knew Jon did it? Altho we know Jon is kinda limited in this season.Back to Council where everything is cringy. Sam discovering demoracy, uncle being humiliated, etc.We have Bran saying *Why do you think i am here?"" as response on ""Do you want ti be king?"" But literally 3 minutes later we have Imp saying ""I don't want to be your right hand."" and Bran responds ""And I didn't want to be king"" Do you even read what you wrote in previous lines D&D?
I undrstand why everyone voted for, but Yara was promised independent kingdom, and now she says Yes without any dialogue?Sansa having a word about people at north being tired of kneeling, and 10 minutes later they kneel to her. Do you even read what you write D&D, again?Grey Worm accepting punishment for Jon and just leaving knowing they will send Jon to wall, because it's not like he hates them and doesn't trust them.

5468,So it's the end of game of thrones I'm so happy to live with this series from beginning to the ending and last thing want to say goodbye game of thrones the best tv show,10,20 May 2019,13,53
5469,"This TV show has aired for 9 years, and had to land the dragons at episode 6. Now I'll agree that the previous episodes of this season has been a bumpy ride with a lot to criticize but this episode really stands out from the bunch.It all starts off with Tyrion walking in to Kings Landing to find his dead brother and dead sister under the rubble. While disappointing that we never got a violent justice to Cersei, it did end up in a poetic justice with Jamie and Cersei. Tyrion proceeds to throw his pin down the stairs after a roaring Valyrian battle speech from Dany who then apprehended him for treason. So far the episode truly reveals that Dany is the next mad Queen.Jon is lead to the room where Tyrion is held captive and have a conversation about ruling and justice in Westeros. Tyrion points out that Sansa can't choose her queen but Jon can. This is a shortcut, but we don't have much time left. Jon meets up with Dany in the throne room and ask her to pardon the Lannister soldiers and Tyrion, and Dany refuse to do so. They share a final kiss and Jon stabs her in the heart. Drogon melts the iron throne, picks up Dany's body and flies away. This is where the story ends. Everything after this point is to conclude the show.Brandon Stark is appointed king of Westeros by the lords. They all agree that from this point on no king will be born but chosen at the same sight Brandon is appointed king by the lords in a diplomatic and democratic matter. Tyrion is punished to be Brandon's hand. Sansa is appointed queen of the north. Arya sails west of Westeros to uncharted lands and Jon is sent back to take the black at the wall. In the final scene Thormund and Jon rides with all the wildlings north of the wall setting up Jon to become the new king behind the wall.All in all the conclusions in this episode is good, the writing really manages to conclude the show and actors are doing a fantastic job. As always the score is ten out of ten.I know many people are disappointed, and up until this episode I have been too. But it's not worthy of the criticism it gets from people who are criticizing the episode on the basis of not getting their predictions correct. It's a solid 9/10.",9,20 May 2019,11,43
5470,"It was a very nice ending ,I love it , It was amizeing i was nearly to cry because we was in the end of the best TV show in all time",10,20 May 2019,27,128
5471,"I was from the guys that really didn't like previous episodes nor to mention the whole season 8. For some reason though the last episode was over my expectations. I would prefer Sansa or Snow on throne but it's not my story. I liked the atmosphere, the music and even the humor that GoT has used to have. Finally it was an episode where i feel satisfied and i am glad for it because a lot of people are feeling really really disappointed and that's a shame.",10,20 May 2019,12,48
5472,"I just recommend you to simply enjoy the series and I hope you enjoy this last episode I think it was extremely beautiful. Don't get trapped on other people's need to show off. It should also not affect the artist work. In this case they conclude a series in what I think was a combination of the writer and the series writers solution. They did a great compromise and it is a perfect ending.Don't read the haters, you can even imagine them screaming angrily more because of their own frustrations than really what the episode was about.",10,20 May 2019,12,48
5473,"I don't know why people criticise the end but according to me this the best and the most perfect ending .
ending was perfect we could notice this also during dany's dream is S2 broken ceiling, she at the wall , meeting khal drogo Rhaegal and viserion (also hearing their sound) and also the iron throne which is freezed (she didn't sit on it ) (also shows that winter arrived and it was melted)
Also bran's vision in S4 and s6 showed that dany is going to burn king's landing
In S6's vision He saw 3 images again and again in particular order 1st pic dany giving birth to drogon (drogon is only visible) 2nd pic he saw dragon flying over king's landing
3rd he saw areys Targaryen saying burn them all
He also saw burning of sept 4episodes earlier in this vison",10,23 November 2020,7,24
5474,"Everything comes to an end and noone really want good things to end and theres no good way to end anything good, I mean not really anyway.But considering the harsh truth of endings this is probably the best end something this brilliant as the Game of Thrones has been.I can only bow to the makers and now be sad it's all over.",8,20 May 2019,28,134

5477,What a brilliant show. I guess that's the best way to end it. It was so unpredictable,10,20 May 2019,19,85
5478,"As the episodes before, i can't understand the critics. The season was coming to end!...what did you expect?
Like something blabla like ""the walking dead""?
It has to be finished and it was great.
Like in every fantasy story there can't be any question to be ansewrered.",4,21 May 2019,8,29
5479,"I will appeal primarily to sensible fans, and not to those who believe that only they know how the Game of Thrones was supposed to end.
1. I am sure that the ending of the Game of Thrones (the murder of Deny by the hands of John, the election of Bran, the coronation of Sansa) was invented by George Martin. In this aspect, there should be no questions for Den and David.2. With regard to the crumpled and illogicality of the plot, such accusations are generally justified. Scriptwriters for certain reasons (lack of inspiration, fatigue) could not come up with the perfect script for the last season of the Game of Thrones. Such a script, probably, could not be. Could Den and David not be limited to one season, and shoot two, three? I think they could. But I still think, and even believe, that for such a complex interweaving of the heroes' destinies, which we observed in the Game of Thrones, the script of the last season was quite good.3. Do not forget the main thing, the Game of Thrones is over. And, I am sure, no petition will force to rewrite of the last season. As after the death of a person, no one speaks badly about him, even if he was a scoundrel, so in this situation no one should speak ill about the Game of Thrones or its creators. By this you spoil the Game of Thrones (the rating of the latest episode is 4.8 !!!). In addition, Den and David created this series and made it popular. This should not be forgotten.Post script: sorry for my English, this is not my first language.",10,21 May 2019,8,29
5480,"The ending is incredible, a bittersweet, but I feel a space. I'm totally fine with bran become the king of the six kingdom, but this not the way to reach the message. I mean we could have a better writing and more episodes.",8,20 May 2019,8,29
5481,"It's a happy end why are you so mad about it !Any way , i'll miss this show badly",10,20 May 2019,8,29
5482,"I think this was the most balanced ending possible. Ghost was petted, Jon got back to the north and also didn't become a king (he didn't even wanted to), everyone else is happy. Maybe Drogon's story should've been ended somehow.Again, beautiful cinematography.I gave it only 8/10 because I felt the same rush, a big hurry to close the storylines, just like in the past 2 seasons.",10,20 May 2019,8,29
5483,"Thank you game of thrones for the these years we spent together, and also big thanks for all actors they were the best, and about the ending it was clear and logic and full of sense and I love it I enjoyed the finale, we gonna miss you GOT 💔",10,20 May 2019,14,59
5484,"While far from a perfect season, the story concluded in a way I found satisfying. Making it a shortened and condensed season was a mistake, however due to all of the development we got in seasons prior, I was on board with everything that happened. What's more disappointing to me is the toxic fan reaction. Do not trust the mass one star reviews",10,22 May 2019,17,75

5486,"First off i would like to start off by saying i have never made a review before but this show in its entirety was so good i would just like to add my two cents on the ending. Second, yes this ending definitely could have been better i do agree with that, but it's not even the ending that is upsetting, it is the way they executed it. The fact is they made the best show and this last season felt very rushed and vital scenes were left out that really didn't need to be. I'm not going to bore you with any more details i just believe that this season was rushed when the previous seasons were so patient and perfectly executed. Last would like like to give everyone involved in the production writers, actors and everyone else huge props and say still the best show ever. Thanks so much been a wonderful ride !",10,20 May 2019,9,34
5487,"Was the finale all we hoped for? No. Was it rushed? Somewhat. Did it fullfill the promise of a bittersweet ending made by George RR Martin way back when? Absolutely. Sure it could have ticked a lot more boxds to make us fans happy, but anyone going into this finale expecting to be completely satisfied and come out happy is deluded. As one character puts it... ""no-one is happy. Which is why its a good compromise"". And for this reason, the finale delivers on everything we've come to expect from GoT. This season shouldn't be watched as individual episodes, but rather one big finale.",9,20 May 2019,9,34
5488,"First off, I'll start by saying this. The fans rating this 1/10 are nothing but a bunch of spoiled brats. Game of Thrones provided you nearly a decade of some of the most brilliant pieces of television ever made, and your 1 star rating is a slap in the face to all the actors, cinematographers, directors, and the incredible Ramin Djawadi. I agree that the season was way too rushed, but the ending wrapped things up sensibly. The episode itself isn't deserving of a 1 star review.",10,22 May 2019,16,70
5490,Feel that I need to score it 10 to outweigh some of of the 1/10 scores. I feel like whatever the ending I would have been sad but this was slightly disappointing. It just wasn't epic like every other ending to every other season. Still love it so much though,10,20 May 2019,11,44
5491,"I honestly don't know what they expected from the game of thrones, we were surprised as it always did. Spoiler: Many people got angry because Bran stayed with everything, but they just gave it to the throne for being the 3-eyed crow. Jon Snow went to the place where always felt full. We have had a worthy end. the construction of the characters was respected",10,3 February 2020,10,39

5503,"Lol funny to see dany fans are quite fool not to understand story...From season 1, It hinted that dany ways of ruling is only to burn her enemy cities, to take everything through fear and remove who ever in front of her she always wanted to take it which she feels her is by fire and blood until she meets Barriston,tyrion who advises her to rule in different way without burning cities and through love, she listnend them but when no one is there to give advised, all betrayal and all loses of her children and friends she decided to listen herself and done she always wanted to do.Her house of undying vision already predicated her fate when she burned cities and ashes falling everyone on king landing and then she saw her dead husband and child which means it predicted she will go to them at end.GRRM also confirm in recent interview that his book ending will be not any different from show ending so learn to accept truth",10,20 May 2019,7,25

5505,"I tkink the season was far too rushed, and they are missing a little bit more of story telling, but I also think the final episode was pretty good and overall conclusion is bittersweet as promised, and I love it. There is lot of details as well that are referring to the previous seasons, and I love how all the Starks got they happy endings. This was their story after all, and now is time for wolfes to shine, and rule the world. I love how their conclusion is that knowledge is power, and that in the end, we don't need wars to show how powerfull someone or something is. Also, I was telling people long time ago that real darkness in the show is not the Night King and his army, but the people who seek power no matter the costs. And at the end, I think that the prince who was promised saved them all by killing his love, the tyrant mad queen by stabbing her in the heart. And Prophecy fulfilled. Amazing story! Btw: Ghost finally gets his pat.😍
Special thanks to G.R.R. Martin,AMAZING actors, producers, and complete crew that made this majestic story alive. I bend the knee to you all. And I give you eleven out of ten, because you deserved it. Love! ❤",10,21 May 2019,17,77

5507,"I honestly thought the finale was gonna be bad, very bad. But clearly I was wrong. This was the best way a show could have been ended. Brandon Stark to become the King of the Six Kingdoms was the best thing this show has done. I just applause the mastermind writers who are responsible for this perfect story arc. I loved Dany, but I'm also glad that Jon killed her and the Dragon decided to destroy the Iron Throne which drove Dany mad instead of killing Jon Snow. This is one example of a perfect writing. Game of Thrones is the greatest series of all time and Season 8 was the greatest season of it. I will miss this show a lot. Thank you D&D!",10,21 May 2019,10,40
5508,"People seem to be using this review section to voice how unhappy they are with season 8 as a whole rather than their opinion on this episode specifically. However you might have wanted the story to go, you're not the one running the show and I think that this episode nicely wraps up the story the writers wanted to tell.I do agree that some of the episodes this season fell below the level of quality and attention to detail that we would have liked, however for me this episode was one of the better ones this season and definitely does not deserve to be at 4.8 (as at time of writing).",8,20 May 2019,8,30

This ending was just right... beautiful actually. And realistic. Again what did you expect? Jon on the throne and Danearys next to him? It was not a happy end and it made me a bit sad... but it was not bad...not bad at all! Thank you writers, cast and crew for entertaining me this past years...I will miss you!!😘❤🌈",10,20 May 2019,14,62
5521,"These reviews are unrealistic and unfair. People are simply being unreasonable because Dany broke bad. Well, get over it! If you missed all the signs over the years, you weren't paying enough attention. Anyone with enough sense to track a bleeding elephant in snow should have seen it coming. As expected, she lost her noodle and got what she deserved. Everything else, including the mild surprises, was logical and satisfying-even the ending for Jon, which Tormund foretold. It was a near-perfect ending for a great show, all these absurd reviews notwithstanding. It couldn't have been much better.",9,21 May 2019,11,46

5532,"I realized I was kinda hard on this ending to the show. So I went back and rewatched and realized by a comment I saw on Twitter that the real enemy of the whole series was the Iron Throne and the power it granted the person that sat on it(most of time that person was an awful ruler), and I'm now satisfied that Drogon burned it(I still don't understand why he didn't burn Jon though). And I'm just ok with Bran as king, just ok with it. Other scenes I liked were Tyrion finding Jamie and Cersei's bodies(Peter Dinklage is and amazing actor. Still can't deny that), the new small council meeting, Briene writing Jamie's good deeds, and Jon stabbing Dany(which Kit also deserves some credit for his performance as well). Another thing that I realized was that Jon ended up where he wanted to be, because he never wanted to rule. He killed Dany to protect the people from what she'd become, not to take over. Plus he's with Torrmund and Ghost, which makes up the best trio ever. And Sansa being crowned Queen of the North was good. She always wanted to be a Queen, but because of the traumas she has endured over the years and how she overcame them taught her that being Queen and having power was not all fun and games. Which all of that suffering prepared her to rule and be responsible with the control she was granted. I really don't know about Arya's ending though. She didn't say goodbye to Gendry or find the Hounds body. Plus I have no idea what's beyond the map So that was disappointing, but everything else was pretty solid. By the way, where did Drogon go with Dany? Oh wait it was Valeria I think. Right?Overall, this series finale of Game of thrones is not the best series final ever(defiantly not as good as Brekaing Bad's ending), but is still a bittersweet sendoff for the series and all these characters and places we've grown to love over the years. Like when a men of the watch dies ""And now our watch has ended"".Finally rating: 8.4/10",4,20 May 2019,4,12
5534,"I thought all the arcs fit together really well. Arya is where she belongs on the run, Sansa is where she belongs, protecting the stark name in winterfell, Jon is where he belongs with his brothers in the north, bran is where he belongs. The person who knows all about the past would be the best fit for the future. That's why you get taught history in school. To better the future, to not repeat the past.",10,22 October 2020,9,36
5535,"I think everyone needs to come to terms with the fact that you didn't like the last season because it didn't confirm the fan theory you saw on Reddit five years ago. I swear it's because Twitter picked apart every single scene and convinced everyone they knew the perfect battle plan, or they suddenly understood what plot armor was.Game of Thrones' final season was detrimentally rushed and left much to be desired, especially for the criminally underdeveloped Cersei. However, what was ultimately presented as the final stretch of episodes did not disappoint, giving purpose to everything that came before it by twisting the knife in a few unexpected ways and ending with an immensely satisfying series finale, all while coherently wrapping up character arcs and providing the boatloads of entertainment the show is known for. Rewatching it from the beginning has only confirmed my opinion.Daenerys did not go mad just because Jon spilled her secret - if you wanted that handfed to you then you're watching the wrong show. It is pretty obvious the writers intended her character to become evermore merciless as the series progressed, and no GOT fan I knew still trusted her by the time season 8 started. I would go so far as to say they started planting those seeds in season 1. Nevertheless, the finale justified her thinking as to why she killed innocent people. She said the same things she has been saying all along: to paraphrase, ""kill all those who don't bend the knee to her."" The whole point of her character was to make you realize such a ruthless power seeker could not break the wheel without becoming the wheel. How does this not make sense in context of the show?It is overtly implied that Jon was brought back from the dead so he could kill Daenerys. This moment was one of the most beautifully shot scenes in the entire show and was foreshadowed back in Season 2 episode 10. It seems most people thought Drogon melting the Iron Throne was cheesy, but not any more than the battle of Hardhome, or Melisandre's character, or Hodor's death.In retrospect it seems almost obvious Bran was going to be king. It was a great final twist and it's why his character has been so important since the first episode. It follows the mantra of the show; he's a cripple, but so what? Why wouldn't he be fit for king? If you're still unsatisfied with this choice, he can literally see the future, so I don't know what to tell you.I've actually seen most people complain that the remaining surviving characters had happy endings. I'm talking about Jon, Arya, Sansa, Tyrion, Bronn, Brienne, Davos, Sam, Podrick, etc. Sure Game of Thrones usually never gives out happy endings, but what would be the point of so much misery for 8 seasons if no one came out on top and got what they wanted? Not to mention all of those characters had perfect endings that logically rounded out their character arcs.In conclusion, I truly believe most people wanted this masterpiece to end with Jon and Daenerys as king and queen, and the last shot would be them riding off together into the sunset on Drogon. If you even for a second wanted that to happen, you haven't been paying attention. THAT ending would piss me off. THAT would be fan service. THAT would be pandering. Jon Snow said for 8 straight seasons he doesn't want to be king, and Daenerys was way too obvious of a choice. I mean, come on, Sam is Grand Maester and Brienne is Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, what more could you want?",10,15 May 2020,9,36
5536,The mad Queen's quest has ended. Jon Snow did the honourable thing. The queen slayer ended up not with glory but being exiled. Like Ned Stark he didn't play the game of thrones but choose to save the innocent.,10,21 May 2019,12,52

Varis deserved to be given more time to develop his distrust of the Queen, a magnificent character dispensed with too quickly, for me, the whole final season felt rushed and disrespected the incredible writing and acting of the earlier seasons, so close, but Pink Floyd can keep hold of the cigars.",5,5 April 2020,3,8
5543,"Well, let's face it, overall this episode is pretty terrible. Not only is it the culmination of everything that has been changing for the worst with the series over the last few seasons, but it feels like a rush job to wrap everything up. This isn't to say that there aren't some good things going on. The scene with Daenerys addressing her army is pretty visually stunning and I thought well acted be Emilia Clarke who otherwise has seemed a little out of her depth this season.Yeah, it's a shame it had a dull thud of an ending, but honestly it was meant to happen. The show started out as one of the best things on TV and then lost it's way probably around the time Arya started doing her Face/Off routine. They kept teasing us with the incredible battle sequences but eventually there was nothing of substance to fill the gap between them.",5,23 May 2019,3,8
5544,"Whilst I won't be adding my name to the petition to campaign for a re-shoot of the whole of Season 8, it certainly didn't finish quite how I was expecting.
There has been comment that the season was rushed, with only 6 episodes as opposed to the usual 10 episodes. Perhaps this was a miscalculation as 6 episodes at 110 mins vs the typical 10 episodes per season at 45 mins still means season 10 was a significantly longer series. Perhaps if they broke the season into 10 episodes that lead up to the battle against the Night King and the immediate aftermath, that would have felt a much longer affair, and would have accounted for a season on its own. Something I thought it needed; we've been building up to that confrontation for so long but it was over in one episode, although an episode that was brilliantly realised.
'Season 9' could have then focused on the resolution of the whole series something that certainly felt rushed in the actual final episode. I certainly don't agree with the view that the end should have seen Daenerys on the Iron Throne, or both Jon and Daenerys as K & Q - that would have been too much like a Disney world view of story telling and totally out of character for GOT. Still, the ending did feel weak once Jon had assassinated Daenerys.
The beginning E6 was excellent however - Daenerys proclaiming her vision in front of those loyal Unsullied evoked chilling images of the Nuremberg rallies in the 1930s.
The scene in the ruined great hall, realising her vision only now we understand it was ash falling not snow on the abandoned throne was cinematic and epic, as was Drogon's arrival.
But, from that point on, i'm afraid, it all fell apart. I'm OK with Drogon being a dragon (!) but i struggled with him smelting the Iron Throne as though passing his verdict on what should happen next. I mean, he's an animal - an animal wouldn't know what that thing in the corner represented by any stretch of the imagination.
The jump cut to the arena with the assembled representatives all sat round as Tyrion was led in looks like it was the next day or so now they are under a clear blue sky and all the ash has gone. Is this a day later, a week, a month? What about the 'Winter is coming' which will be a winter that lasts a decade?
Sansa mentions that the north and other kingdoms have their assembled troops surrounding Kings Landing - I guess that's a result of Varys' raven communication. All of which would have made good material for a Season 9 but perhaps HBO wanted to draw it all to a close and not pad it out for another season particularly as, by this point, we had lost most of the main characters.
OK, so my ending would have been:
1. Same up to the point Jon kills Daenerys and is imprisoned
2. Word of which mobilises the houses throughout the Realm who come to release the one person who was instrumental in saving mankind from the white walkers (see seasons 4 - 7 !) and having learned Jon is also the true heir to the throne
3. The Unsullied and Dothraki, as a sort of Essos axis now face a war against the united kingdoms of Westeros.
4. Jon is sprung from jail and meets Drogon - together they tip the balance in favour of the Westeros allies
5. The Unsullied and Dorthraki surrender (following another epic battle scene) and embark aboard Yara Greyjoy's fleet bound for Essos
6. The victorious Westeros houses unite behind Jon Snow, declaring him Aegon Targaryen, King of the 7 Kingdoms! But....
7. He declines the throne - says what's needed is not a battle commander, a soldier but a civil leader who has compassion and seeks what is right for all of mankind: Tyrion!
8. Tyrion accepts and nominates Davos Seaworth has his hand.
Bran becomes the Grand Maester with Sam as his maester assistant
Sansa does her 'North will remain independent' trick and returns to Winterfell and is proclaimed Queen in the North
9. As for Jon, he's had enough of killing and returns to the true north with the wildings (i agree with that part of the ending).
Both Tyrion and Jon Snow's story arcs over the entire eight seasons would resolve perfectly as these were the two characters who sought to do the right thing and, whilst it was the 'sword' that delivered the ultimate victory to the 'pen', the future success for the 6 kingdoms will sit with the 'pen' to successfully govern the Realm.",4,21 May 2019,3,8

5574,"When did people stop knowing what being reasonable means? When did people lose the ability to make their own opinions instead of making judgments about things based on what they read and watch on social media? When did people stop knowing how to enjoy things? When did people become so hateful? I can't help but agree with one review I read here saying social media are toxic. I won't make an apocalyptical speech about social media. That is not the point of my review. I have used some social networks in the past and I'm not guessing nor assuming what happens there. I know how useful but also how toxic they can be. I know very well its viral effect, for better and for worse. But I digress. One thing I can say for sure is that I enjoyed every single minute of season eight, from the first to the last. And based on the content of some 1 star ""reviews"" I have read here, I don't believe my common sense, my taste, and my IQ are inferior than those of who wrote them. I refuse to believe that.I will repeat it, just so no one thinks I am drunk, high, or delusional: I love every single minute of season eight. In fact, it may be my favourite. And it is not because it is a season full of spectacle and fireworks and action (which, by the way, I don't think are pointless, for the sake of it, for shock value, and devoid of purpose). I actually mean the writing, which seems to be the thing that people hate the most. Yes, I mean the writing. Season eight is the most brave, bold, complex, mature, epic, poetic, artistic, symbolic, emotional, dark, and tragic (and political, if you want) of all the seasons of Game of Thrones. Every episode feels like a symphony. Of course being the last season contributes to this scale and style of writing, and that is the thing I believe many people fail to understand: they mistake complexity, climax and closure for bad writing, rushing of things, and ruining of character arcs. They don't have the life experience, the years, the moral, emotional and intellectual baggage to truly appreciate, interpret, and understand what happens in season eight. And it's not their fault, I respect it. I'm not being condescending nor claiming I'm smarter or experienced than everyone else. I'm simply claiming the writers seem to have written season eight for a very specific audience, for a niche of its audience. That is why I say it is brave, mature, and bold. The writers could have decided not be so and give the majority of its audience what they wanted. But they didn't. And that's where I think all this backlash comes from. That's what happens when mainstream decides to go authentic, artistic, and daring.But it is not only the writing. In terms of scope, cinematography, directing, and acting, the previous seasons cannot even compare to the last one. Especially the acting. Clearly the actors gave everything they had to their characters and the result is the some of the best acting I've seen in my life, being Clarke, Headey, Williams, Dinklage and Waldau the obvious standouts.People claim the main problem with season eight is that everything feels rushed, which makes it difficult for the pay offs to be believable and have emotional impact on them. I never felt that and I find it curious, because it's not like you're watching an average 40 minutes episode TV show. Many episodes were 80 minutes long. In fact, season 8 is 440 minutes long, which means its the equivalent to 11 average runtime TV episodes. Add to that the fact that seasons 7 and 8 didn't introduce any new characters and many other died, so although it is true that these seasons had fewer episodes, there were also fewer characters and arcs to follow. This directly translates into more screen time for each of the main characters in season eight. Try for instance comparing the screen time Daenerys has in seasons seven and eight to the screen time she has in the previous seasons, where in many of the episodes she would only have one scene. The same with Arya. So, the character development is there, more than ever. Things didn't happen out of nowhere for the sake of being shocking. Things happened naturally and gradually enough. The ""rushed effect"" is an illusion created by the number of the episodes. As for ""emotional impact"", it wasn't for nothing that I said before that it is the most brave, bold, complex, mature, epic, poetic, artistic, symbolic, emotional, dark, and, tragic of all the seasons. If that isn't enough to describe the emotional impact it had and still has on me, I don't know what is. Last but not least, and to be short, the musical score is perfection. I guess I won't ever truly understand where the hate about season eight comes from. Perhaps my assumptions are correct and only time will be able to put season eight in the place it truly deserves.",10,22 May 2019,20,99

This review contains spoilers (obviously).Game of thrones truly is without an equal; sure the decline of Dany (for whom I rooted as well) hurts, but it made so much sense and was hinted at again and again and again since the very first season. She had no allies and as her hope was falling apart, her dark side that we've all seen again and again (and struggled to ignore ""for the greater good"") finally consumed her. Her final scene was beautiful and exactly as foreshadowed in Season 2, which made me shiver. The dragon's reaction was extremely powerful as well.Moreover, I'm actually very surprised at how happy the ending (overall) turned out to be; so many open threads were tied up nicely and rewardingly and all the Starks end up where they should :)",10,28 May 2019,14,65

For just one episode they spent 65 nights filming! It's like, if this wasn't good enough, then WHAT is? I know GoT fans are expecting a lot since it's probably the biggest show on tv, at least in our generation. But to rate the finale a 1/10 is just pathetic and rude and NOT true. Arya's storyarc was beautiful to me, she's a lonewolf, a fighter and a free spirit who finally gets her freedom to get out in the world and explore. Sansa finally learns to appriciate her home, the north and become queen like she always wanted. Jon's fate was soo bittersweet and amazing, he just feels like he belongs on the wall, protecting Westeros. Him and Arya are the true heroes - but they're not heroes because they want recognition or any kind of fame, they're heroes because they're truly good. And for them both to not get much credit and just go back to living their lives was so beautiful. So much like Ned.And as for Dany, I suppose that's the real reason everyone is so upset.

After the episode 5 bells, I was sure that Dany is gonna die.That scene where Jon says he loves Dany and embraces her for one last time, broke my heart. But, it was needed to be done as what she has done previously cannot be justified.Just broken for the fact that since season 1 they have developed and struggled wanted and just wanted to see them happy & in peace. Especially after the Rains of Castemere episode. I hope Dany rests in peace.In the end, Jon finally finds peace by going north of the wall for from everything which hurt him.It was just an amazing way to end the series even though it hurts a lot.

Wasted.But I've been re-watching a lot of the old seasons recently. And in light of the last two episodes, virtually everything she ever said or did foreshadowed this.Ultimately Dany was always driven by her conviction that she deserved the Iron Throne. She deserved to rule over others because she was born special. And she killed anyone who got in her way. As an audience we cheered her because these were usually bad people. But you can't use force to get what you want without eventually hurting innocent people.One of the points this show has always tried to make is that we shouldn't have romantic illusions about people. Everyone is human. Everyone is fallible.",8,20 May 2019,7,27

5602,"Not what I expected. Not what I even wanted. It was heartbreaking to see these characters, specifically Dany and Jon, who I've rooted for since the start of the series, fall so tragically. These are storylines and characters that most fans have an emotional attachment to, including myself, but wars are ugly. Power changes people. And this last season has proved that cognitive dissonance can get in the way of seeing the truth. Looking back, the signs were there for Daenerys to become the mad queen. Jon Snow has sacrificed himself and put everything on the line for what he believed was the right thing to do. This was a tragic ending. Would I change how things played out if I was a show runner? Definitely. But I would change them to serve my own hopes and dreams for the characters. However, if you look at it from the point of this being a story about how horrific and destructive wars are, it definitely causes you to challenge your perspective. And I always appreciate when my own perspectives and views are challenged. I still stand with Dany because I love her. And my heart still aches for Drogon.",9,20 May 2019,6,22
5603,"The last episode nicely sowed up an epic show. Generally speaking I like the message it offered. Namely, we'll eventually get burned (pun intended) supporting those using ruthless methods getting to power. We certainly can't be happy using such methods ourselves, nor should it be a surprise if we find ourselves alienated as a result of using said methods.
I still feel the heartbreak of seeing Dany lose it and slaughter so many after becoming a bit attached to her over the years. Her perceived blood right to the throne was a key argument when she first met Jon but she wanted to sweep it under the rug when she found out otherwise. A very understandable and human mistake to make. On a high note, it was nice to see the Stark kids be in a position to positively contribute to the world in a way Ned could be proud.",9,20 May 2019,6,22
5604,Yes agree it felt rushed a squashed in this season but if your a true got fan you do realise it ended the best way it can. If dani was queen the fans would push for another season because she wanted the world. If Jon became king the unsullied would want revenge.

Come on, it is not some shallow fairy-tale.Daenerys, having tasted the power, turned from Miss 'I will answer injustice with justice' to Miss 'Let's burn everyone and after that let's conquer Mars as well'. She became a tyrant (truly her father's daughter) and had to be killed. A great example of what an actual power can do to a seemingly good person.Jon, being sent back to the Night's Watch, is kinda epic. I imagine him becoming an old wise men, counseling the young like his relative and an ex Maester of the Night's Watch, Aemon Targaryen, did. Isn't it an example of history repeating itself? Damn poetic!The imp - the hated outcast - turned out to be the only surviving Lannister, he outsmarted, outlived them all in spite of all the stuff he had to go through.Bran is a perfect fit for a King. He has no hate, lust, tyranny, hunger for power in him. The story begins with him being pushed off the tower and ends with him becoming a king. Damn poetic again!The characters aren't static, they just can't be. The went through horrible and devastating wars, watched their loved ones die/being killed. They survived it all, they finally made it and probably the best is yet to some. But it cost them way too much. And that creates the atmosphere of goosebumpy sadness at the end.",10,25 May 2019,11,49

5610,"So sad and stupid all the people that gave one star ratings.
Do you any other ideas how to end GOT?
Maby a bit longer a few more episodes.
Indeed a bit rushed with plastic bottles below the chairs in episode 6.
For me it was a good end of a great season",10,21 May 2019,12,55
5611,The beast but they should make more seasons the end is open,10,20 May 2019,12,55
5612,"First of all, I have to say that I don't understand one star ratings. I think, we can all agree, that the actors were good as always, the cinematography was absolutely top-notch, as were the SFX. And in my opinion, when rating a film you shouldn't ignore this only because your are angry with the story telling.Secondly: I read a lot of ratings and am not sure what problem many raters have. There seems to be dissatisfaction with the pacing. Well, I agree with that. But I found the pacing far worse in season 7. The filmmakers and writers now had to deal with the showdown of two story archs: the white walkers, and the fight or the throne. I think, you couldn't really slow this down anymore.Thridly many people complain about how the story ended or how the characters ""developed"".
Jon: I don't think you needed him for killing the night king. How could he actually have passed the white walkers? Arya was - in my eyes - the perfect choice for this and I have expected it. An Arya, just going for revenge would have been too shallow. Jon was the one, who united the north and most of the south. He was the only one who could do this. And with this army, the white walkers were distracted. The night king always sent forward his army of undead and only elicited when he thought, it would be safe for him. And then Jon fell from grace because he fell in love with a woman who - actually - turned out to be a dictator. Tragic but not off character. Jon - from the beginning of this story - always needed time to think. He never has been the fastest thinker. And he always made things worse while hesitating. Do you really think a man like him would have been the right choice for the throne? I loved this character but I never saw him sitting on the throne.
Dany: really? I mean: didn't you see this coming? I think, her storyarch is the one most people hated. But she always has been like this. Yes, she ""freed"" the slaves (at least temporarely because she immediately turned to Westeros as soon as she had her army) - of them many didn't even wanted to be freed. She crucified the slaveholders. She looked coldly while her brother was killed. She threatened Tyrion, Mormont and many other advisers, only because they had different opinions. And it has been their doing, that she didn't burn any cities sooner. Now they are all gone: of course she burns everything. She didn't fly the dragon on the ships of Euron when Euron killed the second dragon? Well, how would you react when your child is killed? Do you have the coolness to build a strategy? Is Dany use to strategies? Well, actually, she had always people who did those things for her.
Of course you could have written this differently. As a writer you have choices to make. And of course you can dislike the choices but you can't say, that characters acted out of their typical behavior, because they didn't.
Watch closely to what Tyrion says in this final episode: all the protagonists ignored the bad part of Dany. And not only the protagonists did so, many viewers, as well.
Bran on the throne: the perfect choice. He is the only not corrupted or discredited surviving person.Now people, who were cheering for a series that told its story differently from the obvious don't like, that the story came full circle.I liked this episode and in my eyes it beautifully crafted a final that absolutely fits the rest of this wonderful series. And this is why I give it a full 10.",10,29 May 2019,16,79
5613,"A tremendously exciting and satisfying end to a season filled with tension and tenderness. So many twists that I didn't see coming, amazing shot composition, fine acting by a group of performers who have come of age before our eyes, making us very invested in the outcome of this Game of Thrones that they've been pawns or players in, and Ramin Djawadi's breathtaking score!

5614,"This was actually much better than I was expecting after episode 5 and the writing actually made sense.

5615,"Wow 4.7 rating. Hope you people are proud. Haha. Look.. all the complaints about the warp speed of the last couple seasons is obvioisly justified. However, all the moaning about character arcs being ruined isnt. I think every character pretty.much got the ending they deserved. Yes Cersei's and Jamies, and the Night Kings deaths were a little underwhelming, but thats what you get for building it up so much with all your ""theories"" ahead of time. I made 8 predictions and 7 of them were correct. Only one i missed was having Gendry on the throne when the smoke cleared. Was everything rushed and condensed? Definitely! I would have loved a full season, but this is what we got, and it wasnt bad. Had a bunch of twists been thrown in, the internet would have been complaining about that. Why did Drogon melt the throne?why didnt the Dothraki retaliate ? Plenty of instances like this, but once you get past those the ending was pretty darn good. Like me, just wait for the books. Im sure we will get mostly the same ending, just with all the necessary motivations. Looking forward to it!",8,20 May 2019,10,44
5616,"Despite of episode 4 of season 8, this nearly perfect ending they could have come with. Yeah it's true that no one would have wanted what came for Jon in the end..

Furthermost, after what Dany did, keeping her alive was not an option.
Well I'm more than satisfied.",10,20 May 2019,10,44
5617,"Of course it makes sense for Bran to be the ruler at the end as sometimes it is best that the one not begging for the crown gets it as they are less likely to end up corrupting themselves. He is also the one eyed Raven so has a power that no other there had. A king does not really need to be able to walk and fight in battles (especially if the aim is a peaceful rule uniting the kingdoms) but definitely should posses a wise head on their shoulders.The ending showed how the quest for power and the Iron Throne corrupts most people. It was fitting Jon Snow ended up sacrificing himself to help maintain peace (having killed Kalise) as it also showed his noble side. He was also shown despite its hardship to be most happy when actually North of the Wall (before it was knocked down) and evening finding love with Ygritte so in some ways he will return there as their king in most of the Wildings eyes.Many good ending's and hints what may be further in the future in my eyes but then we are all different and entitled to our own view. What I do not agree with though is extremism in views and the, in some cases, horrible abuse aimed at certain people involved in the show.Fans are important to the success of a show and shows should, to an extent, be tailored to suit the fan base but you can never please everyone at the same time. Also importantly had they had made a more predictable yet fan appeasing ending then there would have also been fans complaining about that too.",10,19 May 2020,8,33

5631,"The whole season 8 seemed rushed, plots were not told in detail and that was kind of sad for the last season. Dany, Arya and the other characters deserve more time to develop their role. All Plot twists need more explanation. BUT the final episode is not so bad as I expected from that bad Rating. I liked that in the Last Episode time has been given to develop the story and wake emotions, even if they were not as big as i hoped for.
After the Bells Episode it was clear that Dany had to die. I liked that Drogon burned the Iron Throne as the throne was everything that destroyed Dany and finally was the reason for her death. I could not imagine Bran as king, but it makes kind of sense... clearly who else would have been left for the throne?
Jon meeting Ghost again was beautiful. And the Starks are back as strong family in Westeros. Scenes looked stunning as in the whole season and Music was fantastic. All in all i liked the last Episode as it made the whole season better for me.",8,20 May 2019,4,13
5632,A beautiful goodbye to a great series. This episode gives a worthy end to all the characters. It leaves space to fantasize how the lives of all remaining characters will be after the great war.,10,20 May 2019,4,13
5633,"No, it may not have been the epic blaze of glory we might have expected the series to go out with. Sure, this season was rushed and could have benefited from being paced out with even just a couple more episodes. But this mob mentality spreading among outraged entitled fans is ridiculous. Just because you weren't a fan of the ending doesn't make the last 8 years a waste nor does watching the entire show mean you're entitled to a happy perfect ending. This is a show that's always prioritized story telling and shock factor over fan service, so this ending is not out of character for the series. I truly dont know how anyone who's been watching this show all along would expect an ending that would leave everyone happy and satisfied because that has never been how Game of Thrones rolls! And while a lot of peoples complaints are with the lack of buildup to Bran becoming king, I found it a lot more satisfying to hear Tyrion lay out a case for him and realizing how much sense it made and wondering how I never considered it before, rather than having that idea slowly spoonfed to me so that I was totally expecting it. And isn't that what makes for a solid ending, one that we never saw coming yet made perfect sense all along? That's why I refuse to grab my pitchfork and join the angry herd of fans just because this wasn't the ending I thought I wanted. Also, top notch acting, cinematography, and production value deserves more than 1 star just because you all want a temper tantrum. The only reason this episode loses a couple stars for me is because Jon's ending just makes no sense, the idea that none of Dany's soldiers or Grey Worm would try to take revenge on him is crazy and sending him back to the Night's Watch to do who knows what is just so bleak and anti-climactic for the series protagonist. It honestly would have been better if he had been killed immediately after killing Dany and his story would have ended there, sacrificing himself to save the realm from a tyrant, instead of being sent back to end the series right exactly where he started.",8,20 May 2019,4,13
5634,"Ok I get it that people are disappointed because it didn't end the way they'd hoped, and yes it's true that this whole last series has felt very rushed, agree with that ... to give this last episode 1 out of 10, as many have done, is just crazy.Even with its issues, this tv series is miles ahead of most in terms of production values alone. Give the hard-working crew, special effects team, cast and whole production some well earned credit! Even if we didn't agree with the script decisions made, we were treated to a spectacular episode with many poignant, touching and memorable moments.

5638,"Well it's over. Eight Seasons of Game of Thrones. Let that sink in for a second.The last episode wasn't as horrid as I imagined. Story wise the season disappointed in many ways. Mainly because it rushed nearly every Plot point. The white walkers were defeated in one episode. Cercei was defeated in one episode. Daenerys switched from liberator to mad Queen in two episodes.
This season, as the last, needed more Episodes. It needed a little thing called pacing. It needed great Dialogues. It was talked as much in this season as in the first two episode of Thrones.I don't hate this season. I'm just indifferent and sad. The only redeeming quality though, is significant.
The production design, the costumes, the cinematography and the music was magnificent. Also I would like to note that the Actors did their very best and gave their A-Game.

5644,"Were the last two seasons rushed? Yes. Could they have used some more time to breath and create nuance? Yes. Were they a failure of epic proportions as many fans say? I don't think so.In a show as popular as GOT so many will bring their own expectations to the table that it would always be impossible to satisfy everyone. But why has GOT season 8 dissatisfied so many? I think in part because it didn't deliver a particular version of whatever ending so many fans wanted to see; it did not fulfill a lot of ""fan theories"" that many became married to in their own minds. In some cases it seems fans wanted characters to be more than they ever actually were (narratively speaking).For example, the Night King and the White Walkers always represented (obviously) the existential threat of death...of an unknown and uncaring force which threatens us all regardless of ones place in the world. Narratively the Night King ultimately fulfills his purpose by breaking down the wall, being really scary, attacking the living (equally and without discretion) and (most importantly) dying at the hands of Arya. In the end, the threat of the dead is defeated by the girl who we have watched grow and train specifically to not be afraid of death; to understand its threat fully but still say ""not today"". This is strong thematic stuff. A lot more meaningful than ""Jon and Dany didn't use proper military tactics"". In all sincerity who cares? The Battle of Winterfell was about the culmination of Arya's journey, the Night King himself and his death were about the culmination of Arya's journey. Every moment of Arya's story led up to that one moment in which she is the only one who can defeat the threat of death and was destined to do so.And it makes sense for that particular story to, in the end, be about Arya's arc because I have always felt that the show, at its heart, was about the journey of the Stark children (Jon included) and where their lives go after the death of their father. For Robb and Rickon, it ended in death (Rickon really not being much of a character at all I admit). But it's the other four's journeys that we follow to the very end.This is not to say, of course, that there were not other important characters whose journeys we also followed, cares about and wanted to see concluded properly; Dany and the Lannisters being the most obvious.Dany: her turn to evil was rushed and lacked proper build up in my opinion. BUT narratively I think it works, just wasn't pulled off as well as I had hoped. But Dany turning to darkness was a nice final ""twist"" for GOT. She was never going to be the ""hero"" of the series because everything she ever did, be it good, bad or somewhere in between, she did out of the lust for power. She was a conqueror through and through and (as we saw in the last two episodes) was capable of justifying any and all actions in the name of that ultimate quest for power and to rule. As was made clear by the eventual choice of Bran as king, this lust for power is something the show specifically condemns. I think in part because such lust for power is always unquenched for those who are driven by it. As soon as Dany has the seven kingdoms she immediately wants more. It's all she's ever known, conquer and eliminate those who oppose her, conquer and eliminate, conquer and eliminate, etc. That was never going to be the thematic choices that the show was going to reward by making Dany the hero. Having one's life purpose be the quest for absolute power, even in someone who many times was trying to do good, is dangerous. Further, the fact that Dany's claim to the throne is based in her birthright as opposed to any actual merit was a further theme that the show ultimately specifically disavows in the final episode.Jamie and Cersei: Cersei was an evil psychopath who had compassion only for Jamie and her children. She was a villain. Her narrative was ultimately more about Jamie. Jamie, unlike Cersei, had a heart and compassion for others outside of his immediate family. We see this side of Jamie develop gradually throughout the show. And for a moment it looks like his kind heart and his better impulses are going to win out. He loves Brienne (a singularly ""good"" woman beyond any equal in the show) and all he needs to do is stay in Winterfell and have a family with her and be redeemed. But he can't. He can't because he has one unrelenting flaw: he's in love with an evil psychopath who also happens to be his sister. That's his ""tragic flaw"" and he was always destined to die with Cersei, who in the end, for her part, dies scared and sad. Turns out she wasn't hard to defeat. She was not the real enemy. Brienne, for her part, finishes the show not as a rejected lover but as the person who literally decides how Jamie is going to be remembered in the annals of history, and she chooses the high road, as we knew she would.Tyrion: his humility allows him a second chance. He knows he backed the wrong horse and made terrible decisions. For all his cleverness and intelligence, he failed as a hand. Bran's first action as king is to give him a second chance to do right in the new world they have created and it's an opportunity Tyrion takes seriously; he wants to make sure those chairs at the small council are just right.So that leaves the Stark children. Arya is off on some new adventure in unknown lands, completely consistent with her character. Bran is chosen to be on the throne. This managed to be surprising but appropriate. Bran cannot father children; it is the end of monarchy based on birthright (first step towards true democracy) and he is the exact opposite of Dany; he has no desire for power at all, in fact he literally says at one point ""I don't really want anything anymore"" what better person to rule?Sansa, on the other hand, wants to rule. But not the seven kingdoms. She wants only to keep her land free and independent. And so it is. And after seasons of seeing her abused emotionally, physically and sexually her story ends with a crown being placed on her head and a sense that she will be a just and kind ruler of her independent people.Finally there's Jon. Poor Jon who only ever wanted to do the right thing but was never too sure how or what to do. But we know he did the right thing by killing Dany. He did it selflessly for the betterment of the realm. And in the end he is back to where he started and to where he was always most comfortable: in the North with the Night's watch. And the show ends with Jon and Tormound leading a united people (the nights watch and the wildings) freely into the land of the true north, no longer having to be frightened by the threat of the unknown monsters beyond the wall.So in the the end, the execution wasn't perfect, the ending didn't satisfy fan theories and will leave many upset. But for me the show ended exactly as it should have, with the four remaining Stark children reclaiming (or going to explore) the world that they almost lost. Bran is on the throne, Sansa is the queen of the north, Arya is off to the unknown west and Jon is home at Castle Black. And the world is free of tyranny (for now).",8,20 May 2019,7,28

5648,"With so much hate on here I wanted to post a review as someone who appreciated the ending. Every character got an ending that was fitting for their character.
And since the story was about the Starks, its fitting that they are the focus of the end.
Dany's arc was brilliantly constructed misdirection. All the way up to the end she could have made different decisiions, but without her advisors, she let the dragon out and had to be stopped.
Bran was a great choice for King because he won't be corrupted by greed, won't suffer from the indecision that Jon would have had, and is respected by all the kingdoms unlike Dany. And he will help transition the realm to Sam's vision.
Jon would have been miserable as King.
Samsa was only ever interested in keeping the North together
Arya gets to be the adventurer she wanted to be.
And the Iron Throne got the ending it deserved as well.",9,21 May 2019,6,23
5649,"I ultimately get why so many have been disappointed by this episode. I too felt like we missed two episodes where Danny starts to get isolated, paranoid and vengeful, and the character changes we were presented with feel like they've come from nowhere.
But unlike most, I'm happy with how it has ended.
Danny had to die, Jon Snow shouldn't get a happy ending just because he's a main protagonist.
Arya' was never going to be able to settle into a ""normal"" life
Everything realistically ended a bit muddled and messy, no-one was happy with any outcome, but check your history books, that's how momentous events often do end.
My 10 stars is due to the fact that it looked amazing, the loose ends were all tidied up, and I dont need to see something on the screen to be able to join the dots.Yes, it could have been a lot better, it should also have been more detailed, but 1 out of 10 from most reviewers seems almost petulant to me.",10,20 May 2019,6,23

Could the series have a better ending, this is only up to the author from now on. I want to defend season 8 simply because the series doesn't deserve so much hate, especially when we loved it so much since the first episode. So yes it doesn't get to end the way you wanted it to conclude, but does it really make it a bad ending then ? If I do agree about some of the complaints, I would like to remember what this season did good : bringing justice (literally) to the world of Westeros.I first wished that when Drogon burned the Iron Throne it meant the end of authoritarian regimes on Westeros and the birth of democracy : sadly it was not the case. That's alright. It was maybe more of a symbol that the tyrans who ruled (or wished to rule) Westeros from while sitting on the Iron Throne are all dead now. And yes Daenerys was one of them. I get that she was a fan favorite since the beginning of the show, and a huge symbol of ""breaking the chains"" (and the wheel) but her arrogance, her self-entitlement and pretty obvious cruelty to people standing in her way, added to the fact Westeros was not welcoming her at all, it really played against her case. And the fact that she could have been a villain since the beginning was a nice touch, I believe. We had signs since the first season that she would eventually turn bad, through her actions and also one vision she had (the Iron Throne under the ashes and not snow like we thought it was). It is only too bad that she was too poorly written in comparison with the books.The Starks obviously were the highlights of this last episode : the scene where Jon says farewell to his family was pretty emotional, but still it made me happy to see him finally PET GHOST GODDAMIT SUCH A GOOD BOI and be reunited with his good friend Tormund. I think his faith is the most emblematic one in the show.
Arya leaving to discover new worlds felt right somehow, she was meant to become a traveler and not stay in one place. Sansa becomes the (independent) queen of the North, like she secretly wanted (the new dresses look nice).
Bran becomes the new king of Westeros : ok why not, he is after all the one who possesses the most knowledge in all the 7 kingdoms now.Overall, I am happy with the faith of the characters, the ending was indeed bittersweet as planned. The fans are still angry with the show, and I can understand them : everything felt so rushed since season 7. Don't get me wrong : even if I'm feeling ok with this ending, I do agree that it could have better writing for both seasons (7 and 8) if only D&D took more time to introduce the war against the WW (I mean come on, make it last longer than one episode) and more character development for everyone (at least make the mad queen plot more obvious in season 7 ? Idk). During the ending I just didn't feel as much as I wanted for the characters because everything was so rushed for two seasons, it just cut ties between the viewers and their favorite characters...I would like to congratulate Peter Dinklage who made an outstanding performance this season, especially over the last two episodes. He truly is the best actor of the show !So overall, season 8 : lots of bad writing and anti-climatic moments, but kept the logic of the universe behind it and made a believable ending out of it. An ending can't satisfy everyone, and surely this one will keep people talking for a long time.Don't cry because of how it ended, but because it's over and we will never have a show as big as this one in our lifetime again.",8,20 May 2019,6,23
5654,"This is not a suggestion on major deviations from the plot, i.e. Changing who kills the Night King or not having Danerys go crazy, but rather it would be a way to salvage the whole thing as I think mostly the problem is just pacing and a little shorting on development.Episode 1 & 2 - No change. These episodes play well leading up to the battle.Episode 3 - Cut out at the 1 hr mark. Instead of giving the whole battle in one episode, roll credits after the Night King raises the dead and the White Walkers enter Winterfell. This increases the anticipation for the battle's climax and leaves the disappointment that some people feel for how it ends for the next episode, making the The Long Night the greatest episode ever.Episode 4 - After the opening, begin with the dead coming to life in the crypt. A few establishing shots will need to be added, but the rest of the battle can play out exactly the same. Whether you love it or hate it, doesn't matter. You would have waited a whole week to know what happened that you would be dying for a resolution, any resolution. Before you can digest it, though, the episode would progress through the bulk of The Last of the Starks, transitioning from the battle with the dead to Danerys's final conquest. Cut when the Hound and Arya leave Winterfell for King's Landing.Episode 5 - This is where I think a few extra scenes should be added. Not to make any major changes, but just to flush things out a bit more. It does feel abrupt when Euron makes his attack and when Jamie leaves Winterfell. And though I enjoy subtlety I think Varys's turn to poison Danerys and her slipping into isolation are a little too muted. There could be a little more inserted here to build up to these concepts for the next episode. Danerys doesn't eat from depression following the death of Missendei, but perhaps before Missendei dies, we see Danerys refusing food for fear of being poisoned. Just an extra 20-25 minutes here and then we end where Episode 4 does.Episode 6 - Plays out mostly the same as the original Episode 5, maybe show the girl getting caught trying to give the poison. Then continue on up until Danerys begins her slaughter. Cut around the 50 min mark when she begins to fly towards the Red Keep with extended shots of Cersei's forboding and a final shot of the dragon flying and shooting flames at the camera.Episode 7 - Begin with the turmoil on the ground and showing Jon's perspective of the slaughter. Play as is all the way until Tyrion enters the Red Keep and finds Jamie and Cersei under the rubble. Maybe add an arbitray scene back at Winterfell to see what Sansa and Bran are doing for good measure and to help with the monotony.Episode 8 - The full remainder of The Iron Throne. Probably the hate for this episode stems mostly from perceptions of Season 8 as a whole, but I would only add a few things and not take anything else out. Flushing out the middle of the season and fixing the pacing I think would greatly improve it and thus the series finale would have been better received. Some people would have preferred to see Danerys not become wicked and her and Jon both becoming King and Queen instead of Bran, but honestly that wouldn't have been keeping with the series. The plot is not the problem.Perhaps some people think that each conflict should have been given a whole season, but what else is left to tell? Everyone is pretty much dead at this point. I don't care if there is more in the books that could have been thrown in. Books work like movies and television. Those would be very long and boring seasons. Now given these few but reasonable changes, Iron Throne becomes a much more fitting end to the series. It's not perfect, but its not off by much.",9,12 April 2021,5,18
5655,"To Begin with:
YES, this last season had many flaws, the easy win over the White Walkers, Dany's bad memory about the Iron Fleet and many more.BUT: I really liked this ending. For me it is the best conclusion this series could have at this point. I admit that it is rushed, you could have at least made 2 episodes out this, but D&D kinda forgot that they could have done more.I like it, eventhough its not perfect (thanks to season 7 and 8).
It feels complete for me, thanks GoT.",9,21 May 2019,5,18
5656,"I can't believe how this is getting 1 star, the cinematography alone deserves 5 stars. The acting, effects and direction were excellent. I admit it has been a bit of a rush this season but I can't believe that the 1 star reviewers find no merit in this episode whatsoever. The hard work that was put into this series by everyone involved should be applauded and when the negative reviewers finally realise that this is how George rr Martin wanted it to end they might show D&D a bit more respect.",10,20 May 2019,5,18
5657,"Let's be real here people; the finale is not the worst thing you've seen on television. It's just not. I personally thought that the ending was very appropriate for what all of the characters had been through, and by the end of season six, I had already started to dislike Dany. She seemed obsessed with being a tyrant, whether she could see it or not, so I was not surprised when she got the outcome that she did.
I'm going to be completely honest, this was *not* the worst thing I've ever seen. This wasn't the best either, but 'The Iron Throne' doesn't deserve a 1/10.
It wasn't fantastic and wonderful, but it wasn't awful either. It was just good. Fairly good. The music was (as always) lovely, and the scenes were both dramatic and beautiful. The acting was on point, and I admit that I felt as Bran was really going to be the king that Westeros deserved.
Despite the poor reviews, I would still recommend GoT to all my friends. It is still the best show I have ever seen, and I feel that I won't find one that's better.
Game of Thrones will forever hold a special place in my heart.
And now my watch has ended.",10,5 July 2019,14,69
5658,"George R. R. Martin prophesized in one of the interviews that there would be a debate on the Internet about the ending of Game of Thrones. I am not sure whether he had it in mind that it would be so extremely polarized as it has turned out to be with so many straight 1 ratings being given along with hateful shout-outs posted instead of what a review is expected to be. Yes, I get it that the narrative writing is not as brilliant as it used to be, that it sometimes feels a bit rushed, sometimes lacking sufficient build-up to important events in the story. So the season is not perfect and there are flaws. However, despite that, I still really enjoyed it - the season in the general and this, final, episode in particular. Even though the writing does matter a great deal and all the other flaws should not be ignored, I did not see them as being that severe or prevalent so as to ruin the overall experience when there was so much else that was good in the finale. And I didn't see any Starbucks - or whatever brand they were - coffee cups and plastic bottles probably because I was focused on taking in the best aspects of each scene and didn't try to look into the corners of a camera shot trying to find some small error to have another reason to criticize. Of course, it's not a justification for leaving these things visible in the released version, but it is not something I would be too bothered about and I would understand that a few small mistakes of this kind can happen in a large production effort that was the creation of this season (55 or so cold nights of shooting the ""The Long Night"" battle, lots of dragon action, almost each episode being almost like a feature film, etc.).All of the main story developments in the episode broadly made sense to me, I accepted and in some cases was glad about the way things turned out to be at the end of the series. Even if I didn't like seeing Daenerys becoming mad with rage and cold-blooded about taking King's Landing, it was a possible way how her character arc could have gone knowing that there was foreshadowing of this in the earlier seasons. And the amount of build-up that was given to lead the viewer to the moment of her giving that tyrannical speech in front of the ruined city was good enough for me. Yes, it would have been better for this to have been stretched over an entire season or more to make it more convincing, but it is what it is when squeezed into just the second half of this season. In any case, it still worked for me well enough. The same goes for all the other major events in the finale including Jon reluctantly killing the Dragon Queen, the Iron Throne being melted by Drogon and Bran being elected as King. Probably unexpected for many but all of that happening that way felt fitting and could be something that will feature in George R. R. Martin's future work as he said that he had told the showrunners beforehand the outline of the main events at the end of Game of Thrones as he had envisioned them. Taking one example of Bran, it seemed like a sensible thing to do to choose him as someone completely different from those who had ruled before which could give hope of much needed peace. Also, the hope could also be for Bran the Broken to bring about positive change in a similar fashion as it had happened with Bran the Builder who built The Wall after The Long Night in the ancient times of Westeros. And I was glad that Jon and Tyrion were given more spotlight time in the episode and their actions - more weight. I thought that the way everything was wrapped up at the very end gave a sense of closure and was, by and large, satisfying, even if the build-up to this could have been done better by more detailed writing in a longer season.Looking at all the other aspects of the episode apart from the writing and storyline events, it was all up to the highest standard and nothing short of stunning if we are talking about the cinematography, costume and set design, musical soundtrack and special effects. And I thought the acting was moving, arresting your attention and completely involving in the scenes - performances that the actors seem to have put great effort into and to have done it passionately. However disappointed you are about the writing, it is not fair to simply downvote the episode and the season with the lowest rating and show no appreciation for the hard work carried out in making the episode excel in these aspects which, in some cases, were better than ever before in the series (cinematography, special effects). All of that should make it worth rating the finale as at least 6/10. For me, who was overall accepting of the storyline events and thought the writing was good enough even if rushed, I would be willing to give it 8/10 but I gave it 9/10 because I felt that, under the circumstances and being under pressure, the creators did the best they could to fit things into a shorter season and felt that they did take the time (more than a year) and were passionate about trying to get it right without having George R. R. Martin's brilliant source material on hand. And the result is not perfect but we do have a final season and a finale of a grand scale compared to anything else on TV - something that was probably hard to imagine that it would go this far from back when the first season was shown.",9,26 May 2019,12,57

But all in all it is save to say that i loved this last episode and its bittersweet ending and that i can only recommend this amazing show. I think if you watch the whole series in a shorter time period, with no two year waiting time in between two season, many people who say the writing sucks will change their mind (a bit) and start seeing the good things of the last season and the connections and references it makes to the earlier episodes.

My point is, this show has shocked and surprised everyone from the begining. And those saying that it goes against charachter development haven't been paying attention; this ending has been set up since day one by George R R Martin, who told D&D what happens. How it all played out might not have been perfect, hence the 9, but it's still visually spectacular, appropriately so and not distracting like The Hobbit trilogy and Garfield (lol).I thought it was a satisfactory conclusion to their charachter arcs and a necessary one. I feel content, and I don't feel lost or disrespected like with the ending to most other series' who leave you feeling rotten and lost like what do I do with my life?

I don't feel the same spark and level of excellence, as the show used to have, from this series but it was still enjoyable, and compared to other shows this season is still in the top tier of television.

I'll lose sleep over these questions!I do feel disappointment at this final episode. Mostly at how rushed it was. Honestly, Cersei was pregnant across two seasons yet a significant portion of the clean up of Kings landing is done in an episode? Tyrion and Jon are both imprisoned and released in this episode yet Jamie Lannister was a prisoner across seasons one, two and three!
Hell all the lords and ladies of Westeros make it to Kings landing, placate the irate Grey worm and decide on a king in one sitting?I've loved this television show for a long time. The scores are entrancing and the visuals are artworks of our time. I've given this episode a 4 merely because it was okay and the love I have wouldn't let me go under that. I am a generous reviewer.
I was happy with Jon's ending, and that of Bran, Tyrion, Samwell and Davos. Even Brienne deserves her place in the Kingsguard. I'm not sure about Sansa or Arya. But I guess whatever makes them happy. Which is what I feel like the writers went with.The good bits.Tyrion lives, I truly believe that his character is the epitome of what is good in the world. Yes he appreciates the company of women and wine but he strives for what is right and just, despite never receiving that himself. If only an imp was taken seriously in the times of Westeros. He would make an admirable king. Sigh.Although Jon was banished to the nights watch, again, he is free. The white walkers are dead, the wildlings are comrades. There is no need for a nights watch and we see him go beyond the wall, a free man. Maybe even adopting free folk status. Aegon Targaryen lord commander of the nights watch, king of the north, protector of many realms, Uniter of the people and a bloody free man. Never to fight again, which truly is all he ever wanted if you were listening. I hope he goes back to that cave and has a bloody good time with Ygrittes twin sister and pretends he never left in the first place.Sam is archmaester. Sansa got her crown. Greyworm got to visit Naarth. Etc.I just don't understand why it had to end so soon with still so much to tell. It will plague me for the rest of my days that such a intricate story was left so abruptly.Robin did a Neville Longbottom, honestly, it would've been nice to witness whether it was only in looks.A shame, it could've been so much more.",4,20 May 2019,3,9

Overall this episode offert satisfying endings for lots of character arcs.And to all the 1 star voters. Well, you are spitting on all the hard work and passion the actors and the whole production crew delivered. One serious advice to you: try to reflect episodes first and consider things that are at very high standards (which you objectivly cant deny towards cinematography, music, acting, unpredictability) before going for rage voting. And if your little imagined story didnt come up, dont be mad. There were million possibilites to end this series of such complexity and imo they have chosen a mix of dramatic and satisfying ways.",9,20 May 2019,6,24

5716,"I personally don't like how they spun the whole season and I was quick to mention all the faults but I have to say that this episode was really good.. there's nothing much to criticize, it ties everything up neatly while leaving the future open. Yes it's easy to criticize but people would be disappointed regardless of the ending, if it ended with the night king defeated like people are suggesting then the same people would be here complaining about how we don't know anything about so many characters and what would happen after etc. It wouldn't be a proper ending. Back to this final episode I have to say I also enjoyed the fact that they brought back certain characters such as edmure and robyn.. I was afraid they'd forget about them but they made sure to close off all character arcs. Brienne completing jaimes story was great too and gave his character a certain finality. The episode even solved the whole issue we all had with ghost and how Jon completely disregarded him in the fourth episode.

Thank you Ramin Djawadi for being dedicated to enrich the experience of watching this unique series yet with unpleasant ending.However, after Danny has been stabbed it felt like the whole magic of the series has been vanished. That plot hole I neither can forgive nor can forget. What made it worse is what came after that. The writing felt like chicken scratches. It was really disrespectful for the mind of a true fan of world of ASOIAF.It broke the heart and made you feel the time you spent waiting for an epic ending was wasted. I wish that you've spent more time trying to write more suitable ending with a higher quality. It doesn't have to be perfect, but with at least amount of pleasant.The acting was great especially Danny becoming undefeatable leader (it was quite magnificent acting), the CGI was wonderful and the efforts of all units was notable, except the writers. What if the ending happens to meet the expectations of the true fans? Is that anyhow unprofessional? Why should you ruin this because you want to surprise the fans of the foolishly unexpected?
I think you should have listened to the books fans who share their thoughts on YouTube, you might have learned how this should done.Shame on you!",4,13 February 2021,2,5
5719,"I am not saying this because I am sad about the finale. Ned promised Jon to talk about his mother. This conversation should have happened long before. When Jon learned the truth about his parents he should have reacted like ""I am the last man of Targaryen. I should breed"". Instead he sent to Nights Watch again. He should have reacted badly but they made him like puppy. And now his bloodline will be dead with him when he dies. At the end of the final, the first step of democracy was taken.In this series, there should be no trace of democracy. The dragon is like smart sentimental creature. Obviously the dragons knew there was a blood connection about Danny and Jon. In the end If Jon had controlled the dragon and set the thrown on fire with the dragon that would have been a better finale. There is speculation about Bran manipulated everyone to be a king but we will never know. And instead of Danny Jon would be a better villain. This is just low quality thinking.",4,23 June 2019,2,5

Unfortunately this season and particularly this episode has lost what this series was all about. Not to mention leaving more questions, holes, and ""what the hell did this or that mean"" than Swiss cheese. The plot also didn't make sense what so ever when it came down to it. Jon Snow kills Dany but is a prisoner? He was demanded back by Sansa and was refused to be handed over? He was the Rightful King and as history showed once a King is killed then the new king is in charge. Finally the thing that really went against the grain is all the starks went their own separate ways. That isn't what they all preached this entire series an out a lone wolf dies while the pack survives. It was a complete letdown. D&D must be in league with struggling shrinks because of the amount of people who are now suffering from depression after last night are booked for the next six months.

There were no pay offs to any character build-ups or histories. No mention of Jon being the true heir (What did Varys die for then?) They did not change a thing. Voting for a King? So, you just gonna bribe your way to be King the next time? Bran when told he is Lord of Winterfell: ""I cannot be Lord of Winterfell, I cannot be Lord of anything anymore, I am the three-eyed-raven now"" - but he accepts to be King? How? And he said to Tyrion he knew he would be crowned King? So he could not stop Danny beforehand?Furthermore, meta-Jokes about the Iron Throne being too small in the series compared to the books? Really? And what about the Golden Company? What about their debt? And why would Bran not know what the west of the seven kingdoms would look like?Sorry, but the writers buchered the story.

This could have been two episodes, and maybe Jon killing Dany could have felt as more than an afterthought, as well as all the characters teleporting to King's Landing after one of those ""X weeks later"" patented use after season 5.

Do you even know what a 1 star rating mean? Honestly, if you think this episode deserves 1 star, you haven't been watching any other TV-show or movie in your entire life, or, you are hate bombing this review site because you didn't get what you want.I mean, it all makes perfect sense. Tyrion even lists how cruel she actually is, although no one thought of it that way, because they were evil men. Evil in the eyes of Dany, is what she sees as evil, not what others think of as evil. Earlier, it was just objectively bad men she crucified and slaughtered.And then Missandei gets beheaded, her almost lifelong advisor and best friend, as well as her highest ranking generals first and greatest love of his life. Tensions were running high before episode 5, and i totally understand her going crazy.And what people are saying about the characters being bland, and totally devoid of their former character, is simply untrue... Jon fell in love with Dany, and she is his queen. When talking to Tyrion he tries to defend her, but knows it goes against everything he believes in. In what way was Sansa out of character? In what way was Tyrion out of character? In what way was Yara out of character? Jon? Davos? Brienne?This was a good game of thrones episode, with a great ending. Even better, it was an absolutely amazing episode for television, compared to what else is out there. People seem to think that D&D ''slaughtered their boy'' and that this didn't end in the best game of thrones style.but again, honestly, what did you expect? I think a lot of people expected to be shocked, but in a way no one could think of. The expectations for this were so high, that they could never be fulfilled, and because of this, an excellent TV season of a show gets review bombed into hell. I agree, that no, this wasn't the best season of game of thrones, but i absolutely disagree that these rating are fair.The only reason I'm not giving this 10/10 is because Sam felt kind of forced in there. Why was he with the council? he's not a maester, have any sort of titles or any power at all. There are still plenty of maesters around to fill that role... Hence why i can't understand he becomes archmaester as well, as he didn't even complete his training. This is the only part of the episode that felt forced and stupid, and the only reason why this is not getting 10/10 from me.If you give this episode 1 star, it would mean you would rather watch Turks in Space or Manos: Hands of Fate than watch this episode. If you give a 3, it means this episode is worse than Catwoman (2004) and The Emoji Movie. Think about that...In conclusion, this was a good GoT episode, it is an amazing TV episode, and the review bombing needs to stop.",9,20 May 2019,10,48

Let's face it,Dany's fate was this from the beginning.The rest of the characters took what they deserved and fulfilled their arc. Season 8 gave us some amazing moments, filled us with feelings(good or bad) but that's game of thrones. That's why we loved it in the first place
Overall I would say that I didn't enjoy a few things in the season and I believe that if we had a few more episodes to answer all the remaining questions then we'd be all satisfied. I believe that the cinematography ,music, design,d acting and all who worked in the last season did an extraordinary job and all who worked on the production deserve huge credit

Then two months later I streamed it. And my opinion is, it is very well made and story writer ended it very well. No more dragging. Thanks to GoT team.",10,22 June 2019,10,49
5782,"The finale was most likely not what the majority of people wanted, but it is done and all over. I think everyone will have their own opinions as to what was wrong (or great) about how the writers decided to end the series , but I thought it was ok. I think that the show was just so big and characters were so vast and likeable that they just had to go with something that made sense and hope for the best. I think most of us foresaw how Danerys would meet her demise, but not how it all necessarily was going to go from that point. Bottom line is they chose to go with more of a positive ending and preserve Westeros. They all came together for common good. Loved the show and can't really complain about the end. It was just ok finale.",5,20 May 2019,10,49

5785,"I agree with many people in saying that this season has been a let down. Be it through plot-holes or uncharacteristic decisions, this season has felt very separate in quality and consistency from the previous 7 seasons.However, if you go into this episode without complaining about the context, I believe this is a good episode. Yes the decision to make Bran King seems a little out of place, but the final layout of characters seems totally in line with their histories. The small council at the end represents honour, dedication, hope, wit, enmity and unity. The North is independent, with Sansa Stark as Queen, which I believe is truly deserved. She has suffered so much and yet has come through and has risen above her strife. Jon Snow made the commitment to a life sentence with the Black in Season 1. Yes he died, and used that to show his life sentence had been served, but isn't it poetic justice that he has returned? He never wanted the crown. No matter how much fans wanted him on the throne, he did not want it. Fans complain about too much 'fan service', yet the decision not to put Jon/Aegon on the throne clearly rejects the claim that the show has just become 'fan service'. His rejection of the crown is totally in line with his character.
Watching Tyrion in this episode gave me such joy - this is the witty imp that we came to love leading up to this season. His way with words seemed to have returned this episode as he spoke with Jon/Aegon, and with the council of the Lords and Ladies in the arena, and then again at the small council meeting.
Arya has stated consistently throughout the show that she has never intended to settle. This was explicitly said to Gendry in Ep4, but of course was also explicitly said to Eddard in Season 1. She was never to settle and become a lady. Her time in Essos also shows her desire to explore and be out of the comfort zone.Danaerys's character arc has been accelerated this season. The shift from mercy to murder, compassionate queen to mad queen does indeed come as a shock in its rushed nature. Now whilst the episodes seemed rushed, do remember that Ep4 takes place over numerous weeks (possibly even a month), if that's any justification for her swift departure from sense. Her honour and morality has been torn internally since landing at Dragonstone. Her nature hasn't much changed, as Tyrion says to Jon. The context of her decisions has, however. In Essos, and more specifically Slaver's Bay, her murder and execution of thousands was mercy, because of the context. Her methods haven't changed since then, it's just that her context has. In Essos she held the moral high ground, in Westeros, she has been slowly losing that moral justification and reasoning. Her decline can be long foreseen before the events of Ep4 and Ep5.Her death was necessary. Jon being the one to do it shows he is the best 'good' of the lot. He was the only one who could rise above the situation, and was the only one who had the position to do so. His Wolverine/Jean Grey take down might have been predictable, but it was the right thing, and I think that the writers were right to make him take the fall (that is, to take the black). It would have been an injustice for Arya to kill her, and a disservice to Jon. Arya already has taken a name that was not on her list (the Night King), alas a second would have been inappropriate for her character. The death of Drogon would have been inappropriate too. He has been the lone wolf of the pack since Slaver's Bay, and it seems totally right that he should leave in the way he did. I loved the symbolism of destroying the Iron Throne. The Throne symbolises the tyranny and oppression of previous kings and queens, and so his destruction marks a new era of rulers in the Six Kingdoms.In conclusion, I think that this episode served to salvage some of the decency that the show once held. This was more Game of Thrones like than most of this season. The end was never going to be as convoluted as the politics in the middle seasons. How could it? This is the end, where all the plot points come together. Of course it's going to become a linear story! As I said before, this season has been a let down in various ways, but I believe that this Season Finale, heck, Show Finale, was written and executed brilliantly.",9,20 May 2019,7,31

5802,"Okay. I just finished watching the finale, & to be honest & unbiased, I felt that it was actually satisfying enough, somewhat like the LOTR & Hobbit had it. The only flaw ever to taint it's reputation will be how it got there in the first place through all the unfortunate rush created in the last 5-6 episodes just to finish the story, which is due to multiple real world reasons besides D&D.Nevertheless, I'm glad they at least kept it realistic enough in this one more than anything. After all the turns, they had to get back on the ground to play the ""Game of Thrones"" to come a full circle to the first season. Perhaps some fans were expecting a lot of fantasy which would never have lead to a sensible ending, like showing an eternal continuation like in this, especially for a show (not books, because in books it's not that weird to mix in elements of different genre here & there).Ironically enough though, this episode is directed by D&D, the now regarded doomed-writers. Maybe they should've done that all along for the rest of the episodes, so that the tone would've been maintained even, if it was possibly going to help even a little.Anyway, thank God they didn't ruin it entirely
to it's core, at least with the ending; even after butchering some character arcs & providing unjust deaths & survivals to some major characters (at least in the ways how some survivals are played out in the scenes - it was either Writing or Directing issues). They finally did give a purpose & ending to all the surviving characters, instead of laying them to waste, apart from the ones possibly reserved for the prequels or sequels (eg. Quaithe, perhaps Drogon too, etc). Nevertheless, it's as they said, bittersweet, but satisfactory & realistic enough.My least favorite moment- nothing more to add to the Night King, but it may never have meant to be, who knows; the books are not out yet.
My most favorite moment - Drogon finally melts down the iron throne that was the root of all the wars, a fitting ending to The Iron Throne in Game of Thrones.To the quick-concluding ones not getting my message clearly, I still signed that petition. If a more sensible season 8 could be possiblly remade, then why not? At the same time, I can't stop thinking straight just because of the mass bandwagon. Just because some people can't themselves recognize, choose & settle on their reasons for hate, doesn't mean everyone needs to hate everything. There is something known as duality, learn to accept it. This was a good ending, thank you very much, there could never have been a more sensible ""ending"", I stress only on the way it got here, that is not sensible but nevertheless helpless at the same time at this point at least; that I've already addressed!",7,20 May 2019,8,38

5814,"Perfectly mediocre and disappointing.So we get a happy LoTR-esque ending to one of the most cynical shows in TV history. The way the season was set up, it couldn't have gone otherwise.
It looks like Jon Snow had to be brought back to life to....kill Daenerys? I mean, that's it? So Beric's resurrections held better ground than Jon's?
Okay. Bran became king, having made zero decisions for himself other than becoming the GPS for the Night King, after a bunch of Power hungry old dudes listened to a war prisoner's recommendation. A prisoner who has been proven wrong too many times in the past.
I can understand that this is how things were supposed to end, but I'd appreciate a coherent story in the process. And all in all, that's what the last few seasons lacked: coherence. The events happened because they had to. The show is making perfectly clear why GRRM is taking so long to finish the book: it's damn hard to find a way to go from point A (the ending of the last season) to point B (the end of this season) without sacrificing any sense of pace, coherence and realism.
The worst let down was the metaphysical threat to the entire world that was the Night King. He was a card that could have played a vital role to saving this season's outcome. He didn't. He was just Deus ex Machina'd out of the way.
What about the Lord of Light? What about Bran's time bending abilities? We won't know now.This series had maybe the best setting I have ever seen: Human characters, emotion, politics, realistic brutality in a fantasy world with dragons and magic, accompanied by a grand metaphysical threat to which the world stand oblivious. However, it crumbled under its own weight, and the writers failed to stay faithful to the setting until the very end, delivering one of the worst disappointments of all times.Sad.",5,21 May 2019,4,15

Who worked on the show, informed the shows creators of how it ended and was just as responsible for said ending as any of the writers. Everyones acting like Danys descent into madness was a shock, once again not the shows fault, if you're too dense to follow the hints that have been dropped since season 2 that's hardly the shows fault, that's your own ignorance and the way YOU put a character on a pedestal. Frankly between the swarms of negative reviews and polls to recreate the season most of you appear to be nothing more than spoiled, lazy and entitled children.
As for the episode itself, it was far from the best, the ending did feel forced, but if thats how the creators choose to tell their story that's their right. Game of Thrones has been an amazing ride, waning somewhat as it aged but still strong the vast majority of the way through. I would still recommend watching it start to finish.

They also wanted to add some funny moments like marvel studios dose (because that's the mainstream these days). But could not deliver and they end up serving ice cream with pickle.2. This could also be result of an unhealthy dispute. D & D wanted *something* from HBO and didn't get it. So they decided to stick it to production house.",1,21 January 2020,3,10
5825,"If there is anything that the division and outrage at the final episode shows, it is how many people have come to love the characters in Game of Thrones, and how many of them are struggling to accept the last goodbye. It certainly left me feeling quiet and ponderous for a couple of days.Oddly enough, the most moving scene for me in the episode had nothing to do with the final scene between Jon and Daenerys. What got me was the moment Brienne took a pen, opened The Book of Brothers, and finished Jaime Lannister's entry. Where it had previously ended with Jaime's betrayal of King Aerys and his subsequent nickname of ""Kingslayer"", Brienne added every single honourable deed she could remember of Jaime, however personal it may have been to just her. Finally, after racking her brains for more, she ended with ""Died for his queen."" That this queen was the ruthless and sociopathic woman whose incestuous relationship with Jaime was the reason he ultimately left Brienne, after a long road to almost redemption, just shows how much Brienne is prepared to put her own interests aside to make sure the man she loved gets the story she feels he deserves.The big question is of course whether Daenerys gets the ending she deserves. I watched it with a sort of numb sadness rather than shock because for me it had seemed pretty inevitable from the end of episode 4. The amount of disagreement among fans over this just emphasises how Game of Thrones has always been about characters that do not fit squarely into boxes labeled ""good"" or ""evil"". When Jon asks whether it was good what he had done, Tyrion answers ""Ask me again in ten years."" Likewise, the reception of the final season of Game of Thrones may well have changed in ten years' time. For now, I think we can agree that Daenerys' instant assessments of what is right and wrong were precisely what drove her to the insane tragedy that ensued.The other big questions that the episode raises have to do with how awkwardly the decisions are made regarding the succession. Initially, as Tyrion is a prisoner, Greyworm does not let him finish his thoughts about choosing a new ruler. But then other leaders of Westeros start to listen to Tyrion, as they have done before. And Greyworm, who knows mostly how to fight for Daenerys, is no longer certain over what to do with Tyrion now that Daenerys is no longer. And the same goes for what to do with Jon, for that matter.The main thing I missed in this episode was how Jon presumably was found, or turned himself in, after stabbing Daenerys. One could imagine that the Unsullied or the Dothraki would have killed Jon. But then, he had the support from most of the allied forces whereas Dany's armies were now without a leader. Likewise, one could imagine that Jon would have asserted his better claim to the throne in defending his attack on Dany. But he had made it abundantly clear he did not want to be king. It would have been an exciting scene to watch, like the scenes in which Tyrion approaches Cersei knowing full well she is armed, and wants him dead.The whole tentative process that led to Bran's election as a man of knowledge rather than strength was sparked off, in a way, by Drogon destroying the Iron Throne, but not Jon Snow. I was initially surprised at this, but then it was already said in earlier seasons that dragons were far more intelligent than people might give them credit for. And the scene of the dragon melting the throne illustrated the end of one era, and the beginning of a very new and unknown one, very well.In the end, I think most people got what they deserved, if not what they wanted. Even the Hound got his revenge on his brother, and it seems fitting that he faced his worst fears and chose the flames eventually. The Unsullied got their own ships to sail, and good hope of a new start in the land Missandei came from. But most importantly, the Stark siblings and Jon Snow each went to a place that felt right for them.Satisfying is not a word that fits very easily when you feel sorry to see the last of all these people. However, when Jon was reunited with Ghost and with Thormund and the rest of the Wildlings, it was clear his new life had started, and that we as viewers are not necessarily a part of that anymore.",8,11 June 2019,3,10

5832,"I must say I found the ending to be really smart. It destroyed all the conventional rules of movies and TV shows, according to which the main characters will be victorius and ""sit on the throne"", in this case. The fact we didn't get to resonate with Bran or that e was not a sympathetic character or had a major importance throughout the seasons doesn't make him an objectively bad or improbable king. See Tyrion's speech for that, I thought it was spot on.To those complaining that Jon didn't get his rightful position. Did we all simply forget one cannot trust a Targaryen? That when a Targaryen is born, it's like rolling the dice? We loved and cheered for Dany for 7 seasons and a half. We hated her with a passion for the last two episodes. I think it was the most clever move to cast Jon TARGARYEN away from the throne and prohibit him from fathering children. For the sake of a balanced, more risk-free world, even if less mythical and noble.On the other hand, I found the pace towards the climax and the ending to have happened very fast. Dany goes crazy in a split second and she doesn't even get to say something or have a sense of closure with what happened. Cersei and Jaime's deaths are sold cheaply, the Seven Kingdoms become six simply because Sansa (which I have personally never cheered for - even in her most developed phase she still struck me as a bitter, anonymous noblewoman with no big talent for leadership and no big love for people). The Unsullied simply forget and leave Tyrion AND Jon alive, when they butchered a whole city of innocent people with not a second thought. And what happened to the Dothraki again?What does ""I might be able to find Drogon"" mean? A full grown, destructive, angry dragon roaming freely around the kingdom, and they just let him be and MAYBE find him later? Who's gonna control him? The only one who possibly could is Jon and I'm guessing after the recent events, that Drogon doesn't like him too much anymore.All in all, it was a little rushed, a little empty, a little too many questions unanswered. I'm frustrated because a good ending was delivered cheaply.",6,21 May 2019,3,10

That shows that humans can NEVER be a good ruler , there will never be a perfect human ruler and i think the three eyed ravens plan to take the throne is a brilliant idea and we should really think more of why the writers made him the ruler . I didnt really expect dany or john ruling .The first seasons , the table of counseling was full of powerful people , and now they are all dead . and replaced by who ?! Tyrion, Sam , Bronn , Brienne , Potrik , sir davos . Those who were really nothing at all . this is another great idea .I am a starks fan from the beginning , the fact that this season started by betraying Ned stark , killing him and finishing it with Ned Starks children is just amazing :') .the throne being burned by drogon because it is the reason why danny died . this is also what happens in the real world where we live .the love of POWER and the greed of wanting morebrienne finishing the page of jaimme lannister-john going to where he really wanted to be in the first place , with the wildlings

5836,"Ok. Haters gonna hate. All of those who dislike what they got are now flooding imdb with bad reviews. Alright. I'm not gonna try to make you like what you don't like.
Sure this isn't perfect. What it really is:
Season 8 is 380 or so minute long fantastic trailer for a 10 season show with 10 episodes each. We don't get the full 10 seasons, so we have to stick with the ""trailer"". So certainly it lacks information. We have time jumps. We have missing pieces. But the important elements are all there and even with all the missing parts it still works.
There was no other way the tv show could have ended. This is just it and it is possibly what George R.R. Martin had in mind when he told Benioff and Weiss what he planned for the major characters.
The people who are now disappointed are mostly to focused on the book series. This is a tv show, not a book and it can never be as complex.
It is a very good final episode - and it was a very good season. If you don't like it you will have to wait for George to finally finish his books. If that ever happens.",10,20 May 2019,3,10

Jon Snow got a very raw deal after saving the seven kingdoms and being the should be rightful ruler of the damn seven kingdoms. I definitely saw it coming for the mother of dragons to end up the way she was going. Earlier in the seasons they told her that she probably needs to stay on the other continent and rule over there as the queen. Which would have been a good idea considering she did at the hands of Jon Snow who had no choice but to kill her to save the world from her craziness. All that being said there's no way in hell I could give this episode nothing but 10 stars. This entire show is 10 Stars.",10,16 April 2021,5,21
5845,"What a finale. This season was high on direction, action, VFX and some terrific acting. While the writing did let down the show, D&D should still get credit for getting Game of Thrones to tv and making it the most mega tv series ever. After all, GoT did create a culture amongst fans that no other show has till date or will in the near future.The scene between Jon, Dany & then Drogon later along with the last 20 mins of this episode were so well acted & emotional. The Starks lost a lot in the first 3 seasons, the Lannister's did so in the latter ones. It's all about how you finish no matter the start.This series will be missed !!",7,21 May 2019,5,21

5847,"First of all there are many better ways the show could have ended but the writers have chosen the worst way.
When I started watching game of thrones final season I felt like most of the people (disappointed). So I started thinking of a better way to end the show, and this is what I came up with.
The story can remain the same but in a reverse way. What I mean is, start the first four episodes with Jon and Daenerys fighting Cersei and her army, and then for the two last episodes let who ever won the first fight ( Daenerys or Cersei ) fight the dead in kings landing and make a really long fight that it lasts for two episodes, and make the night king death much more epic. At least that way the show will have a much more better ending.In conclusion thank you to all the cast of one of the greatest shows if not the best in all TV history for this amazing job that you did.
And now our watch has ended.",8,20 May 2019,5,21

5857,"I honestly can't understand why so many people are giving this episode a 1 star rating. Are you honestly saying you didn't like one single thing from this episode? Not one? People are rating this a 1 out of pure pettiness. Sure, the season was rushed and had a few unanswered questions, which is the main reason I'm not giving it a 10, but overall I thought it wrapped things up well for all of the characters.I don't know if people just expected Daenerys to take the Iron Throne and for her and Jon to get married and have a baby and live happily ever after? Because we all know if that would have happened, people would have been angry also, because it's too predictable.Dany was showing signs of this behavior ever since Drogo killed her brother right in front of her eyes and she didn't flinch or blink. Sure she was executing, crucifying and burning bad people leading up to season 7, but that doesn't take away from the fact that she felt almighty and power hungry. It's very believable what happened to her character this season. Would have appreciated a bit more time developing it this season, as I mentioned before I thought it was a little rushed, but overall it felt very believable.I definitely didn't see Bran becoming King in the end, so that was definitely a surprise. Was I rooting for that ending? No but it makes sense.Jon got a great wrapped up ending because he was happiest in the north beyond the wall with the wildlings. Some people feel that all of his development was for nothing. Wrong. He won back Winterfell, convinces Dany to help fight the dead, and eventually brought Dany to the justice that she deserved, as heartbreaking as it was to watch (especially Drogon's reaction).All in all, this show/episode does not deserve the harsh criticism it's getting and the fact that people are petitioning to remake the season is ridiculous and rude.",9,22 May 2019,10,53

5873,"Yes it was rushed and yes, it wasnt as good as the episodes/seasons before. And yes, I am rating a 10 because everyone who is rating a 1 is doing it out of anger and not because it is justified. First of all, the special effects, the sound and the pictures were amazing - during the whole season. Therefore, rating a 1 is just wrong. Second of all, the actors did a great job and I loved the part where Drogon's wings were behind Dany as if they were hers. Amazing moment. So I do not understand why everyone is getting so upset. It was still very enjoyable! Of course, the whole season was very rushed and there should have been at least 4 more episodes to make it more believable but it was still great to watch. Dany had to become mad, it was clear from the beginning. She did not even blink when Drogo killed her brother or when she killed all the others through the seasons. Of course she thought it was justified but still John for example would have reacted differently while watching someone die. Dany was always kinda crazy, but I still loved her and was sad about her dying but GoT was never a serie to make you happy. But I do understand the disappointment about Bran being King. I dont think its wrong that he became king, it makes sense after all. But it was wrong how he became king. Too rushed, everyone agrees, no one else wants to be king... and no explanation (except the one from Tyrion). But I do not think it his wrong him being the king. I am pretty sure its a good solution for GoT. Bran knows everything and therefore cant be tricked and Tyrion as his hand, is the kind person who is good with talking to people and convincing them. They are a perfect match.
So all in all I'd say a rating 6 to 7 would be justified! So stop acting angry and rate this season as it actually is.",10,22 May 2019,11,61

5886,"First, I must say that in all the many series I've watched I never watch anything like Game of Thrones. I know that are lot of shows which are good like Breaking Bad, True Detective and others, but GoT is something entirely.
All the main characters have a special place in my heart from now on, and if you may see as a tragic ending I see as a beautiful one. Daenerys was no more the beautiful character thatn lighted our hearts like the S01E10 and become ""more of the same"" as Jon Snow stated in seventh season. Still make her one of the most emblematic characters of all time, and that's why this show is so beautiful, it makes me THINK a lot of things, as the premium paid for what we want for, and the curse we have to face when you achieved it. Daenerys chose the power over his lover, over his friends and become obsessed with fire and blood, as Grand Meister Pycelle stated in the last episode of season one about her father. In what concerns Jon Snow, on the other hand, he had to sacrifice his love and his honour in favour of what he knows that had to be done. The altruism of the character is something you see in many heroes, but how real as Jon Snow showed in all the seasons is very difficult. There are no benefits from altruism itself, you just are because you know that's the right thing to do ... The passion of the fire and the beauty of the cold ice, just heart-breaking! A Song of Ice and Fire, such a beautiful song that is. It will sing in my memory untill I have none.",10,22 May 2019,10,55

Warning ; Spoilers AheadThe 4th episode was a shame with Brienne and Jaime - there was no need when after all you wanted to show that Jaime had to die in Ceresi's arm. And the way it happened was plain pathetic. The celebration was awful to say the least.However we all knew Dany was going to die .. but what next .. I expected Drogon to kill Jon . Yeah sorry readers.. I know you wanted Jon to be king .. but I just review it back to when Drogon saved Dany from Jaime in the earlier seasons. But well I can ignore the fact that Drogon thought Jon is Targareyn and stuff. But there was Unsullied and Dothraki waiting who could easily outnumber Notherners and kill JohnThe acting of Emilia Clarke and Greyworm was awesome. Tyrion was at his best. Jon did what he needed to, and for me he couldn't have been king after that.The philosophy that ""Love is the death of Duty"" has been aptly justified by making Bran as the king. Love and emotions disarm you from reason is what Jon and Tyrion discuss and that is what is making of Brandon Stark, the broken, the first of his name, the King of Andals and the six kingdoms,Episode 3 and 4 were shambolic for me, but I am satisfied with the last episode ignoring a few details.",8,20 May 2019,4,16

So yea, even if the last few episodes aren't the show's strongest, they're still 10/10s. Every episode of GoT deserves 10/10, I truly believe that because if I couldn't give an episode of this masterpiece a perfect score then by that logic no movie, tv show, tv episode or video game , etc would be a 10/10 then cuz this show is quite simply as good as entertainment / cinema gets.",10,13 July 2020,7,35

My grade is actually a 6.5 but I gave it a 10 because it definitely doesn't deserve a 4.2, speaking as someone who watched the whole series in a row, knowing the Mad Queen twist.

It is by far the worst season Game of thrones has ever seen.However, it's actually a fairly entertaining series. Acting quality barely degraded, it even improved for some actors. Consistency may be affected by too many subversions but it didn't ruin the show. In reality these are mostly minor subversions that weren't that inconsistent if you actually payed attention. When you let go of petty fan theories and the mindset that your favorite character has to have the ending that you want, you'll realize that the finale is a mediocre episode, but not as bad as people say.",7,12 June 2019,3,11
5919,"I personally LOVED the episode.1. Jon got what he wanted. Tormund always said to him that he belonged in the North. He never wanted to be a king (I think he has said that a zillion times by now), he is just like Aemon targeryn, he didn't want It though they both were the heirs. And if you understand, Jon didn't settle in castle black because there is NO nights watch. For the first time in life he got what he wanted. He was free. Tyrion and bran tricked everyone (greyworm, dothraki, Yara, etc) into believing that they have given Jon a life sentence, whereas Bran knew (he always knows) that Jon wanted to go with free folk (his best friend tormund and ghost) and he let him.
2. Sansa got what she always wanted. Season 1 episode 1, she quoted that the wanted to be a queen. And she got it and she deserved it.
3. Arya got what she wanted. She always was curious about what's west of westeros (she mentioned it in the earlier seasons), and now she will see it.
4. Tyrion was once again honored and got what he always was good at, 'he drinks and he knows things'.
5. A lannister crippled a stark, a lannister crowned a stark (how effing beautiful and poetic that is). All hail Bran the broken who obviously knew what's to come.
6. Brienne truly loved Jaime and she made sure to fill those pages on which Jaime was mocked by joffery. Jaime got what he wanted.
7. Bronn got his castle (we all wanted him to get one, didn't we?)
8. Drogon realized the reason of all wars and destroyed it. Also if his mama didn't get it, why should anyone else?
9. Sam got what he wanted. Grand maester now if you think that how can he be that as he stole from citadel and blah blah. Remember, bran is the king. He can make any kind of changes he wants.
10. Jon snow's azor ahai prophecy came true, didn't it? He stabbed the woman he loved the most to bring the dawn (dawn = new beginning = freeing people from a tyrant like Dany). And that was the reason of his coming back from death. He united all the people to fight against night king, and he killed Dany to bring the dawn.
11. Jon's heritage revelation was the last nail in the coffin for Dany's journey towards madness (she was showing the signs since the start ). But the wheel had to be broken. It wasn't about the rightful heir anymore and AGAIN, He never wanted it.
12. It might not what you expected but since when GOT has gone with the expected endings?In the end I would like to say, NED STARK WOULD BE SO PROUD OF HIS CHILDREN. THE PACK SURVIVED.",10,25 May 2019,3,11

5923,"An ending how it should be. Maybe it was rushed like the other season 8 episodes, but there was more logic to it. Dany went more mad, Jon did what was needed to protect the realm and Bran knew where he should be to become king, giving some reason to his last season.The only thing that bothered me in this episode is they didn't show enough reactions. F.ex. Grey Worm when he heared Dany was killed. We didn't see any reaction, suddenly they were picking a new king. These reactions are crucial for character developement. If they showed Dany more they could show her becoming mad. In episode 5 she seemed to panic when she destroyed King's Landing, in 6 she seems very determined to go through with it. What did happen in between?All those people who voted one star are being ignorate fanboys. Acting is outstanding, special effects are great, the storyline in general is the one by George RR Martin. If you don't like her going mad or getting killed, that's not even D&D's decision. Season 8 should be better. It had some major plot holes and character inconsistency, but overal doesn't ruin the series (thanks to the partly original storyline).",6,21 May 2019,3,11
5924,"Whole season on the whole is awful. Finale is not as spectacular as we have hoped for but no way it was that poor. Few thousands fans who first watched started the criticism and it spread like a wildfire with others catching it.
Dany had to die after what she did killing innocent women and children. Jon was never interested in the throne, Arya was always going her own way, Sansa's motive has always been a free North, so who was left to rule the kingdom? bran the broken.
Night king, Cersei's deaths were lame, everything was so rushed but all characters ended up where they were supposed to be. The only frustration was not seeing any vengeance from Dothraki and Unsullied. They should have sought for the revenge for her queen/blood of the blood at the very least.
As many pointed out why did no one was protecting the queen? Because there was a giant monster guarding her at the door. He allowed because he smelled Targareyon blood. He knew it was Jon who killed his mother. Rather than killing the last surviving Targareyon he rather decided to end the root of all evil- an iron throne.
I'm not denying that there were many loose ends, plot holes, things that were not explained or story arc continued/followed but whatever ending they came up with was never going to satisfy every single fans.",7,21 May 2019,3,11

5932,"The ending was far from perfection, but that's how it's supposed to be isn't it? The goal is to not make it a fairytale, and having characters endure long, emotional, stretched, grand deaths does transform it into a fairytale.
There was wasted potential, indeed, but I found this ending beautiful.
It was depressing and uplifting at the same time, what's depressing is that the Starks are far away from each other in different corners of the world,
The mother of dragons died right after her destructive victory, but a fan favourite and all knowing Bran Stark is in control of the kingdoms and Sansa Stark queen in the north.
The world is greatly unsatisfied with this last season, and yes, it has its shortcomings, like the disappointing end to the huge Night King storyline.
This season wasn't what it could have been and the fans deserved more after all they've invested,
But, conclusively, talking about this episode, they did end the series well.

It also gave me tears when she was saying goodbye to Jon cause they has always had a strong connection!I Also loved that Bran got to be the king, not for he is the one who deserve it. No for he is the most justified one cause he is as Tyrion says an memory for Everyone to remind them of law of justice !And at last the big climax that Denarys was the threat all this time and she had always been by our sides as watchers and to see Jon killing her while Hilding her in his arms whas really gut punching!And then when drogon Burns down the throne it felt absolutly fine cause dany was kind of the last symbol for the throne and by her death we now understand that you don't need a throne to rule just people you can rule over!Now a song of ice and fire is ended i am going too look forward to see more of this universe!",10,20 May 2019,3,11

It's not about the rightful heir to rule the world but the wise and thoughtful to lead the world and to build it. And this last episode has fearlessly done the right thing. On the other hand people got used to the violence that they witnessed and expected more to happen and made their logic that who should be dead and who should rule. If the writers would have followed the whims and fancies of people's wishes it would have been a raw message passed to the world.

People don't seem to Realized that even if D & D were the main architects of season 8, George R.R Martin was always implicated in the project and did set the guide lines where he wanted the show to go after the books. Blaming D & D for not getting what you wanted of series is completely childish! Like Mr. Martin said we needed to expect a Bittersweet ending and this I what we got! My only complaint is that I was expecting more of an action pack ending, mostly because the events in episode 5, episode 6 felt a little flat because of that. Thats why I giving an 8. But in the end All the pieces felt in place and all of the characters got what they deserved, we could argue on the faith of Jon I'm sure... but it is what it is..Thank you GOT, it was a great 8 Years!!

While the Imp and Jon were the forever underdogs of the saga. Oh and the NK was just for zombie-lovers but in the end he was just a DUMB zombie.

Admittedly, the rest of season 8 (bar episode 2) was a step down from seasons 1-6, but nearly everything about this episode worked quite well. While the Daenerys burny insaney arc was rushed and underdeveloped, this episode provided a satisfying conclusion to that.

This is close to the ""real"" life... In a war everyone loses... Someone or something!!! So come on... Think about it

I though the next scene was the next day.Why is Bran king. He didn't deserve it. What is the reason? No buildup nothing. Just Bran who claims the iron throne because he fell out of a window.And this is just the tip of the iceberg.I give an 3 for the cast, music and the team behind the scenes, they have done an incredible job this entire season. it's so sad they won't be remembered for it.",3,21 May 2019,2,6

However, I would not say I have wasted 9 years of my life for nothing: the series was great, helped to discover many wonderful actors, either completely I know at the time or very little known. It gave us many fantastic scenes and episodes.Was I hoping for a better final season? You bet! But it is also worth remembering that without D&D there would have been no GoT at all; expensive fantasy shows was never a hot commodity with the networks or premium channels. Without them, no one will have anything to be angry about as there would be no show at all and many of the great actors would continue to be unknowns.

Sure, Arya never used her face-swiping ability...Wait, where am I going with this again?Oh right.The good parts of this finale. And I will admit, there were a few, hence the 5 star review.Cinematography: stunning as always.Acting: spot on as always.Music: beautiful as always.But two particular moments honestly broke my heart. First, Tyrion coming across Jaime and Cersei's bodies. WOW. Such a well acted and well shot scene. Second, Drogon finding Daenerys dead. Again, heartbreaking. These were stand out moments.And I can't even be too mad with where the Stark children ended up (minus Bran). Jon, Sansa, and Arya all had a last, touching scene before they went their separate ways, fates that suited all their characters.The writing all the whole last season was rushed, but I am grateful D&D pulled enough brainpower together to give us a strong final 5 minutes.RIP Daenerys TargaryenAlso, if I wasn't using my dad's HBO account and was actually paying for the subscription myself, I would cancel it.",5,21 May 2019,2,6

5961,"The majority of the reviews you will read for this episode and indeed this season are very negative. With the majority going so far as to give it 1/10 which is, let's face, it an insult.The problem with a show this big with as open a story line is that many people imagine the ending they want and create a narrative/fan theories to fit this. When really you should just watch it and enjoy the story that is being told.The world is unpredictable and complex. People are unpredictable and complex. Whilst almost all stories have a logical progression to both the story arc and character arc Game of Thrones is does neither and that is why it is so wonderful.No one, but no one could have predicted the events of the final 3 episodes and yet it is a story line true to Westeros and to each of the characters there in. Yes of course Jamie loves Cersei, Varys protects the ""people"", Jorah dies defending Dany, Tyrion stands up to bullies, Dany is damaged goods and yes even Jon (Aegon) chooses honour over love (remember Ygritte), he is the shield that guards the realms of men and now settles back into the life he had always planned for himself.There is no magic end. The people of Westeros continue to go about their lives. The wheel is remade albeit slightly better, there is a better shot at a decent life for most and Aegon's watch has begun. Again.There is no silver bullet to finish off a series as wonderous, beautiful, frustrating and awe inspiring as GOT which is why I give this episode a 9. A 10 is impossible and the best we could hope for is a clean end which is what we were given, even this is a magnificent feat.I'm left satisfied, disappointed, saddened, surprised and optimistic about the future all whilst wondering what if with a lingering fear about what lies beyond the wall in the long night to come. Beautiful.",9,20 May 2019,2,6
5962,"Ok so my initial reaction to this finale was disappointment and anger.
However once I started to think about it all it was a great ending. People were annoyed that we hated cersai for 8 seasons to never see her die; wish fulfilled and at that we still nearly felt compassion for cersai as we watched her Jamie clutch onto each other even in death.The starks after the first season were left with nothing and now look at them. Bran is king of the 6 kingdoms, Sansa is queen of the north, Arya is leader of the free world as she goes off on her voyage and as for Jon, Jon never wanted to be king in the early seasons Jon's ambition was to be in the nights watch and now even in punishment he gets to serve as leader of the nights watch surrounded by people who accept him and see him as a leader.I believe this season was rushed as does everyone I feel that with a lengthier season, watching the demise of Danaerys would have been all the better, and I know this season isn't going to be anyone's favourite however I think it is unfair to call this a bad episode or ending just because people didn't get the ending they wanted or because they were going into with already a negative image just because they didn't like the season.

Honestly the fans and characters deserved much better, much much better.
Could have given the show this rating but the season 1-4, 6 were masterpieces.
Thank you D & D for ruining what was supposed to be the greatest show ever.",4,20 May 2019,2,6
5975,I would like to thank D&D that it isn't a dog's dream. Thank you guys,1,20 May 2019,2,6
5977,"I can't believe thats true why do that ?
it's very terrible to us session 8",1,20 May 2019,2,6
5978,GJ D&D you managed to troll millions of people including myself.,1,20 May 2019,2,6
5979,Season 8 and this episode was so bad I can barley believe it...night king nobody...Jon snow...nobody...we got no payoff for Cerseiwe get nothing...8 years and they give us nothing but king bran I'm so angry I can't even articulate it,1,20 May 2019,2,6
5980,"They took everything that made this show great - and decided to get rid of it. And kept the thing which they thought made the show great - shock value, fan favourite characters' plot armor.Every character acts totally irrationally and, well, out of character.Bran literally does nothing the entire season? Doesn't contribute to anything? Oh let's make him King.Dany suddenly goes mad. Sure, why not.Sansa literally doesn't have any reason to doubt Dany, yet she acts like that (Probably because showrunners knew in advance how Dany was gonna turn out to be).Everything happened in this for the sake of shock value and seemed force.Literally felt nothing about any of the event in this season. Just forward and get it over with.",1,20 May 2019,2,6
5981,"This is only a ""good"" closure for the mess in season 8 that D&D put together but still it is horrible, and left me with a pain in the stomach. I take season 4 as the end of the series, what happened after then season by season is just ridiculous. This is what happens when you make a show from year to year without having a concept about the whole storyline and ending.",1,20 May 2019,2,6
5982,"The ending was far too predictable, its a great shame that the writers didn't feel they could keep to the essence of GOT and what made it so successful in the first place..it's unpredictability.Even before watching this episode you knew Jon Snow would end up killing the Mother of Dragons and once that happened...it literally become boring..what really happened for the final hour. Yes they all go off in their separate directions, but the care factor is zero. It is plain predictable and very disappointing...no last minute twists or turns or anything...which is literally what this whole series has been about. It is a shame this series didn't follow through, but I will always remember the best of GOT as the first few series..probably up until the book ran out..",4,20 May 2019,2,6
5983,"I have a question. That was horrible! Like Dany's army multiplying, Dany went berserker because of??, John has became a mindless beta, euron wtf??? 8 years of my life wasted. Thanks guys",2,20 May 2019,2,6
5985,Why bran the king !! That's not game of thrones i really shucked,1,20 May 2019,2,6
5986,Bran...seriously???? And that about sums it up people.,1,20 May 2019,2,6
5987,"I consider GoT one of the greatest TV shows to have ever been, despite the final season.Season 8 felt rushed, the plot of GoT was always thick, confusing at times, but it was exhilarating to follow all the strands, always on the edge of ones seat.Not so for the final season. GoT died like a fly, quickly splattered against the wall. All the strands of plot that were woven throughout the past seasons to form this intricate storyline were quickly disassembled. They all ended in a generic and predictable fashion, more thought was put into CIG then the plot.6/10.",6,20 May 2019,2,6
5988,Last episode made me cry how bad it is. I spent 8 years following show and this ending.. Doesn't make any sense.,1,20 May 2019,2,6
5989,I'm not saying anything but i remember that the night king destroyed the wall how it's getting build again?????? And what's the target of the knights watch if there's no more walkers and no more aothers and the Wilding aren't in fight with the Westoros???,8,20 May 2019,5,23
5990,"Ok it's not good season but this episode deserves more than 4.6 it's unavailable that people is giving the episode 1/10 , you should rate the episode, we all know that this episode have a good things and bad , we shouldn't forget the good things in the episode.
I want to send a message to D&D , you should have more seasons and more episodes , 6 episodes isn't enough , G R Martin said that they could do more seasons and they not why because they have plans with Disney
""Star wars"" . You destroy a fabulous series like GOT , you can end the best way for this series, but it so disappointing that we see GOT like that ,",7,20 May 2019,5,23
5992,"The white walkers and the night king should of won, would of been well better ending than that pile of crap.",3,20 May 2019,5,23
5993,This has been the best thing on tv over the last 10 years. The Bells almost ruined it : this has saved it. The truth is we needed 3 or 4 more episodes between The Long Night and The Bells to properly deal with Dany's madness and that rush through dented this final season. Ultimately however this episode redeemed those failings : this all made much more sense than Dany's 10 minute conversion to mass murderer. Great use of Drogon. A good choice for the new ruler and some poetic final scenes.,8,20 May 2019,5,23
5994,I don't get the hatred on the final season. Was it rushed? Yes. They left a lot of unanswered questions but I enjoyed every moment of it. It still gave me the same feelings I got throughout the other seasons. The cinematography was absolutely brilliant as usual! My jaw was on the floor more times than I can count. If you're mad because it didn't end how you wanted then that's your own fault. I went in with zero expectations and this episode delivered. I feel like every character ended up right where they belonged in the end...it felt good seeing them all take over and go about their lives like they did.,9,20 May 2019,5,23
5995,"There are no situations where everybody is going to be happy, don't have massive expectations.",5,20 May 2019,5,23
5997,"Yes this episode and season were not the best we have seen but it certainly doesn't deserve one star ratings, at lest two in this series including the finale are a ten in my view. Yes the story was a bit rushed but that hardly justifies saying that its the worst finale ever. It seems to me a lot of criticism for 'bad writing' comes from people who are upset that the writers didn't end it exactly as they wanted. I certainly had another ending in mind but I still think that the ending we got was excellent. A nice twist and something we rarely see in movies and TV, a proper goodbye with all the main characters left alive so it doesn't feel unfinished or like we need another 5 seasons. Yes ideally they would have stretched the show out to another season, something I'm sure HBO would have approved for the profit side of things, but the writers wanted to stick to their plan and just end it where they said they would, 3 years ago.Another thing that a lot of people seem to have forgotten is that GRRM had many discussions with the writers and told them approximately how he saw it would end so he hasn't just been ignored. Also, back then it seemed that Martin didn't actually know himself how he was going to end his books whilst the writers said that they knew how they would end by Season 3, so they clearly spent a long time planning it. If Martin hated so much he probably would have told them to change it at some pint.The acting has been great, the visuals spectacular and I genuinely feel happy with the ending. After all the time, effort and money put into this by the actors and production team, I think we need to be a bit more grateful for the amazing experience that has been delivered to use over the past 8 seasons. Thanks so much to Martin, Benioff, Weiss and the whole cast!",8,22 May 2019,12,73
5998,"The first thing to take into account before judging The Iron Throne is the obviously impossible task to actually make a series finale in general. Especially for Game of Thrones which is one of the biggest TV shows of all time. Game of Thrones has been potentially the greatest TV show of all time due to its character development and amazingly set build-up to the end. And with all of that build-up, it's nearly impossible to create a finale which actually ends every single storyline and subplot. When you actually think about it, this ending wasn't good but it was a whole lot better than it could have been. The writers DID actually write some amazing scenes in this episode like...Dany as the Dragon, Jon killing Dany, Drogon burning the Iron Throne, Dany TOUCHING the Iron Throne. So much of this stuff works so well in the context of ending a show...it's just it wasn't good enough to end Game of Thrones.Look at one of the greatest series finales of all time; Avatar: The Last Airbender. This finale was so good because it delivered exactly what an ending needed; character arc endings, lasting conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist, and a final ""solution"" or just an end to everything which knows what it wants to do. This ending was everything it was built up to be and it ended up being an Amazing ending.But imagine what this ending would've been like for Game of Thrones...this show needed to do something huge and needed to have one final plot twist. (SPOILER ALERT FOR EPISODE 5 THE BELLS)Dany going mad was that one final plot twist, and I think it worked pretty well. The only problem is that out of both storylines (the night king storyline and the iron throne storyline), the writers chose the wrong storyline to put the plot twist in and that's easily the biggest problem with this ending.The wight walker storyline had been masterfully built-up over the years and that was the plot that needed the twist. It needed to impact the show. BUT it didn't and that created a worse ending in almost every way because it made everything with the wight walkers mean nothing. When you take the wight walkers out of the picture though, this ending wasn't half bad. The biggest problem with it was who ended up on the Iron Throne. This definitely brought down the episode for me but it didn't take away from the first half.This episode opens with the aftermath of the Battle of King's Landing and stays in the same setting for like 40 minutes. These are easily some of the best 40 minutes of Game of Thrones we've ever gotten because of how the writers managed to do exactly what they wanted. They had an idea for what they wanted to do, and in these 40 minutes they did exactly that. It didn't question what it wanted to do, and it didn't contradict itself.As someone who doesn't actually disagree with the idea of Daenerys going mad and burning down King's Landing, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the first half of this episode and it created an incredible first viewing. It had incredible cinematography, stunning visuals, and the acting was great. The writing was also considerably better than it had previously been in season 8 and so it ended up being incredibly good and miles ahead of what season 8 had previously done. What brings this episode down though is the second half of the episode. The second half of The Iron Throne could easily have just been it's own episode but was unnecessarily crammed into an hour and half of what was already a good episode. The tone of this episode changed extremely drastically from dark and sad to light and cringy. It ended up being extremely rushed and almost ruined the first half of the episode. The very last scene of this episode was great but didn't make up for the last 30 minutes which was just awful.This may be one of the only Game of Thrones episodes which is actually made objectively better by the music, the visuals and the cinematography. Usually those two things would barely actually be part of what makes good TV but with The Iron Throne, these things actually really make you feel for the characters and it makes it more realistic and it doesn't seem unearned or cringy. It tells us that the directors made exactly what they had visioned and that in of itself, is incredibly impressive. Some people may disagree but this is just my sole opinion on the episode.All in all, The Iron Throne started out as a masterpiece for me due to how impressively dark it was and how it perfectly represented the directors vision but was nearly ruined by the last 30 minutes of the episode which was cringy, unearned and filled to the brink with bad choices and stupid moments. All of this brought up by incredible everything except for mediocre writing and weird choices which is why I think it deserves an 8/10.",8,18 July 2021,4,17

6001,"People are emotional. People love and people hate.The finale it's just ok. In fact It is in GOT tradition: another main caracter dead, another unpredicted turn. But, I have to say, it is one of the endless possibilities.Oh, you do not like it? Hmm... The author, as any other puppeteer, may do as he pleases! It could have been worse :)... And, yes, I would prefer the last season to be better. It lacked the wit that I loved about it before.So, I would say it is an average good end of the series. Not great.But, ladies and gentelmen!

6007,"I sat through Game of Thrones and for the most part enjoyed it as it sucked me in. The portentous dialogue and half hearted belief in itself as a mythology could get wearisome but overall it was a well made, well acted fantasy series. A poor eighth series was wrapped up well in this finale with , for the most part, the characters getting back to business as usual. The only nagging doubt was the rather simplistic manner in which the White Walkers were despatched. At the very least I expected them to be in at the death.",8,21 May 2019,6,30

6009,"This episode made me mad-I'll admit it. Several of the characters don't have the happy endings they deserved. But let's be honest: the sound design, visual effects, acting and direction were all excellent. Yes, even the writing, at least in terms of dialogue if not in terms of overall plot choices. Tyrion gives a number of very insightful speeches, and when Dany explains why she did what she did in the previous episode I thought she made sense, at least on her own terms. The episode is chock full of callbacks to previous episodes with real emotional weight. Even if the show doesn't make all the call backs I wanted, doesn't have the twists I was predicting, it is still a beautiful, albeit sometimes frustrating conclusion to one of the greatest shows ever.",8,20 May 2019,6,30
6010,"I had/have many of the same complaints as everyone else with this last season, but I have to give credit for this episode doing things right.
The pacing was perfect for a series finale, slow with building musical swells and emotional poignant scenes with minimal dialogue.
The twists/surprises included made sense with the characters' personalities, and were surprising but not absurd or included simply for shock value. The decisions made felt organic, the endings appropriate, and I was pleased that the final scene bookended the opening scene of the show.",7,20 May 2019,6,30
6011,"If I could give the fans 0 out of 10, I would. Never have books been adapted to the screen better. Never better directing, effects, acting, etc. That George R.R. Martin had not finished the series before the TV series was finished created mystery around where it would end up, but, guess what, Martin was heavily consulted on every episode to make sure everything fit together. The whole arc of the series and every character in it was perfectly resolved. I've been saying from the moment I read the first page and saw the first episode that Bran was the key to it all, and so it was. Jon Snow was always going to be a tragic figure. Dany's grief and sense of divinity overpowering her reason was always inevitable. The final episodes were shorter on dialog because *everything has been said*! In the end, you only have to look at their faces to see what has to happen, and the actors did this perfectly. Now, I did think the last scene with the Small Council carrying on in King's Landing as if a few repairs and some food from Highgarden would sort everything out was comically upbeat considering everyone in King's Landing was dead, but it was nice to see characters we have come to like running things.",10,24 May 2019,14,90

6015,"Daenerys was crazy (first of all because she was a woman and) because she wanted to bring the French revolution 3 centuries earlier. Why don't these sexist showrunners make one episode only with farmer characters, to see their filthy lives? But the bloodshed of a war is worse they think; worse than slavery. I think stories should have background theory. Read ""Political thinking for the masses: way to freedom"".",3,12 June 2019,1,2
6017,"Once the show overtook the books in season 6, the quality of writing took a very small drop but overall season 6 was still amazing, but 7 and 8 where D&Ds lack of interest in finishing the show is where the quality of the show's writing and storylines truly plummeted.Season 7 was at least passable, if there were different writers and it was 3 episodes longer it would have felt like a much more complete and satisfying season. Sadly most of the characters suddenly seemed one dimensional and little attention was given to any subplots that had been previously set up. For me the only outright positive was the idea behind the pacing of the season, focusing on Dany's first encounters in Westeros, the Lannister's attempting to strengthen their forces, all the while the Night King is approaching and Jon understanding he is the real threat.Season 8, writing wise, was an utter failure. Taking this season at face value, the pacing was way too fast, characters were truly one dimensional. everyone's actions were very basic, nobody was plotting or being deceitful (never found out was Varys writing those letters was about), 7 seasons of character development was thrown away for multiple people, we never found out anything about the night king, Bran didn't utilise his power to see anything past present or future or to warg, Arya just showed she was quiet and didn't use her powers as No one. Most annoyingly the show forgot about everything else happening in Westeros or Essos, there were so many unfinished side stories that were all completely ignored. Thank you to everyone who worked on this show to make it as good as possible, except D&D for the truly abysmal and unmotivated writing and to the producers who let any of this happen.Season 8 should have been 10 episodes long with the Battle of Winterfell at the end, season 9 focusing on Cersei's alliances and Dany and Jon's hastily trying to plan how to deal with her, all the while dealing with the aftermath and grief of the night Kings attack. It could have ended with Dany's attack on Kings Landing, with 2/3 full seasons of build up displaying her slow descent into madness(rather than one episode...). Season 10 could have been about her taking over as ruler, being killed by Jon mid season and then the last few episodes being the remaining house's setting up new leadership.",2,23 May 2019,1,2

I no longer have the desire to re-watch the entire thing because now I know it all ends nonsensically. *To those who say the opinions of fans like me doesn't matter or I'm being disrespectful know that I paid money to watch the show that earned you millions. Now I feel I was duped.

And still in this episode I don't think that I disagree with the destiny of the different characters, what bothered me was how they got there in this episode. This episode was completely RUSHED. Not only are crucial decisions unrealistically quickly made without any objection, big parts of the story are simply gone. And I mean, sure, if things are straightforward you can skip them, but they weren't! In specific John's story line is simply incomplete. Had they simply taken double the time, they could have had told us the full, and probably logically consistent story, but by skipping half the scenes, they really messed up the final, a shame.",5,21 May 2019,1,2

Johns parents meant? Did the writers have amnesia and forget everything that happened the last 7 seasons?
I used to watch game of thrones because the motives of the characters were almost un-questionable, now my kids could pick it apart with ease and kids have, this has become just a meme for stupidity not 'epicness' and greatness.
For the ending of such a great show, this was very badly done. Great for everything else, but the writers should be ashamed of their rush to the finish attitude.Heres and ending.
Arya goes to kill Danny, gets close, dies trying. John kills Danny for killing Arya after all his ""you are my queen"" BS. Drogon kills John for killing Danny. This would have tied up so much better for Bran to be king.But now we are left with, Johns going where and why? Why didn't Tyrion tell everyone who John was? Why didnt Jamie kill Cersei? (Even as a mercy killing to stop her being raped by the north men, allowing for his whole story to still be as it was but also for fill the prophecy). Where is Drogon going? Arya is now Dora the explorer? Gray worm just leaves? Why did'nt they just wait for Gray worm to leave the be like oh hai John, he's gone come on back and chill and loads loads loads more of questions that go unanswered! Go team writing force! Time to F-up Starwars!",1,21 May 2019,1,2
6024,"Well, I read the leaks before the episode. And it was immediate that the leaks we're true. First of all...oh look it's snowing now, glad it decided to snow for one day to make Bran's vision true. Grey worm is executing prisoners, Jon is like ""no"" and worm boy is like ""yes"". This is important because Jon keeps walking and somehow, grey worm is on top of this Star Wars set before Jon. The dothraki are there and the unsullied and they still somehow have a large army despite being massacred at winterfell. Cool. Also, Tyrion walks through the keep or whatever despite it falling apart. Awesome. He goes and whatdayaknow, it's Jamie and Cersei. They should flat out just have a audience at this point telling us when to laugh and cry because this feels like a sitcom with a crazy budget. Oh and remember when Cersei and Jamie we're hugging, and the keep pretty much collapses? Well screw that, apparently if they just stepped to the left or right, they could have survived because there's no rubble in a lot of areas next to them. Anyways, Dany is making a speech and no one can hear her, well, I expected no one to hear her because she's just talking and the army is a whole 200 yards away. But the dothraki are going crazy because they're stupid and the unsullied are doing their stick stomp because they're stupid.Moving on, Tyrion is all butthurt because Dany went bananas and he throws his hand thingy. Dany is upset, she would definitely kill him, she is the mad...oh no he becomes a prisoner. Because he's needed for the plot later on. He says some stuff to Johnny boy, like, eh you know what to do, use the force, whatever.So Jon just walks up to Dany, alone, nobody else, despite they're being obvious tension between Grey worm and Jon...so I guess grey worm is stupid now too. Anyways, Jon and Dany stare and talk and boom, Jon kissy, then stabby. And Dany just dies... seriously, she just looks at Jon and dies immediately. Cool. Jon is sad. Then, boom, drogon shows up and is upset. Obviously, he sees Jon, he is gonna burn the sh...oh no drogon burns everything but Jon, including the throne, and it's a long shot. It melts...the throne...it's so symbolic. Hooray. So drogon just picks up Dany and peaces out.Moving on to some weeks later, Tyrion is still prisoner for some reason. greyworm is taking him to a trial...okay. oh look, it's all these people from the kingdoms, cool. They're all gonna decide about Tyrion and Jon and greyworm is upset but totally cool with them just debating about who's gonna rule now. Tyrion makes this stupid speech about remembering things and says bran should be king because he has a good memory or whatever. But Bran, doesn't want it, he doesn't want anything he....oh no he wants it. Cool. Everyone is like ""cool that's cool"". Except Sansa, she's like ""no the north is independent or whatever"" and bran is like cool. But greyworm still wants justice. What shall they do with Tyrion? They give him a promotion, from prisoner to hand of the king. Why? To fix his mistakes. Yup. And greyworm is like ""okay""... BECAUSE GREYWORM IS STUPID! Oh and they send Jon to the wall, to the nights watch. I think Tyrion says something about there always being a need for a nights watch... pretty much bs to answer everyone who's asking why there is still a nights watch. It would have been better if Tyrion broke the fourth wall and said directly to the audience ""that's right, the nights watch is still around"".So greyworm screws off back to essos or wherever with the unsullied and dothraki to free the slaves...right, because after slaughtering women and children, I'm sure everyone is cool with being part of the good guy team. Jon says bye to stark family. Arya becomes Magellan. Sansa is queen of norf. Tyrion is with his council which includes bronn, which doesn't make sense. Screw Bronn, he's a sellsword, who tried to betray Tyrion and yet Tyrion is cool with him I guess. Whatever. Pod is a goldcloak. Brienne writes stuff for Jamie. The last scene Jon is at the wall, meets up with tormund and ghost gets a pet. They all walk to the north, aaaaand that's it.Short summary, the episode sucked.",1,21 May 2019,1,2
6025,"Everything feels so unrealistic that it's hard to feel anything in the emotional scenes. I have so many questions...
Where did Khaleesis dothraki army come from? Didn't they die in episode 3?
Why is Jon Snow so very unintelligent?
Why did we not get to follow the new king before he got chosen? As far as we've seen it feels unlikely that everybody would want Bran as the king. What do people know of him?
Why did everything feel so ridiculous? Like the scene with the first council meeting.
Why has nobody gone west of westeros before?
And it was a very unworthy ending for Jon Snow. I guess the king saw a fret from eventual children. But come on. Jon is his brother... This will not happen in the books at least.",3,21 May 2019,1,2
6026,"FYI: I loved all 7 seasons of GOT and then there was this terribly rushed illogical season 8 with the worst finale ever. It was like the writers never read or watched any of the last 7 seasons - and ended it with more gigantic holes with lack of character development and history - that everyone i know that loved GOT was flabbergasted by such atrocious writing.Spoilers: Jon Snow ends up back on the Wall (which is broken and there is no threat anymore). That is his reward? Also instead of him killing his Queen he defended so adamantly forever... maybe use Arya to use one of her Faces to pretend to be maybe Queen's top soldier. Anyone really. The lack of creativity is so far fetched that even the notion of the Dragon melting down the Iron Throne is just pathetic. Really? Did the Dragon suddenly realize the Throne had some meaning or was it the danger stuck in her side that confused him as to the real culprit. The dragon never did anything like that before.. so sure.. lets just have him Burn the Throne to the ground. Brilliant idea. Not!That is all you could come up with after 7 seasons of everyone striving for this valuable Throne?.
And to top it off... Jon Snow is not killed after killing his Queen. Or made the King which was pushed for so so long. Huh? There is no way her loyal followers would just dust off their egos and walk away.
And Cersei and Jamie die in each others arms.. just 10 feet away from possibly being alive if they just moved over a tiny bit. It was the last 20 stones that got them killed. Hilarious! I think his fake hand could have stopped them.
Why not have him still breathing just to say a few last words - that would have been just as pathetic as the rest of the finale.And the best part is that the crippled almost non existent character of Bran who is always high as a kite flying as a Raven most of the time, this character that is not even a central person is somehow King. Huh? Why not put Sam on the throne while you are at such trite levels. And Arya decides to become Arya Columbus and wander around the unknown West. Huh?Pathetic is the best word to describe this terrible finale. More holes and open ended plots than a true finale but maybe it leaves room for a Season 9 one day in the next century with different writers.. or maybe the original George RR Martin will rise to the occasion and finish the last 2 books and provide a more appropriate finale. At least the acting was fantastic and special effects also. Kudos to them!1 star because 0 does not exist.",1,21 May 2019,1,2

6028,"There must be a clever underlying reason for this horse poo of an episode as nobody in their right mind would choose to end like this. The bit where they decide who is king was absolutely bizzare. Maybe Brandon warged in to Jon at the beginning of the season to turn him in to a complete wet drip so that he could be king. FFS, Brandon's back story came to absolutely nothing, All he did during the long night was sit there looking like he was on drugs, why on earth would he be picked to be king and why on earth would Jon be sent to a broken wall to protect it from nothing.

A story about a throne which had to be conquered succeeding against fierce warriors, giants, norsemen and even dragons and an army of undead. Everyone was sure to see an epic climax in 2019 but what was delivered after two years was merely a battle between writers and their greed for money. A tale which was told by an old man through books was gifted down to us to be seen in a tv show lasting for more than 60 episodes.

Poor choices and poor writing. If you think Lost did a number on fans that followed for 6 seasons, D&D did one on all of us following it for 9 years. I'm actually glad it's over.

I'm sorry but the series I loved it's not the last season. I didn't enjoy the first 2 episodes. 3 was a good one and 4 was nice . Episode 5 though was one of the best on the visual aspect. So I was expecting something really great as the end of the series. Episode 6 though seemed like :' ok guys let's shoot and get it done with'. I really can't believe that we have been expecting this season for almost 2 years. I can't understand either the 1 or 10 ratings. Got was not supposed to be a soap opera. Happy ending for characters that they were supposed to be dead after episode 3 / 5. I'm really happy I was a part of the series since the begining, but right now I'm so glad that it ended and they didn't pulled it even more for furthermore seasons.

This episode,and final season in general, felt like a straight to VHS movie in an age of streaming.Im sure there are literally a millions of variables the makers of the show have to deal with, and it's extremely difficult,but in this particular case they literally got almost everything wrong when literally everything was in their favour.

6088,"I'll try to briefly sum up the positives and negatives of the episode, while also referring to past episodes building up to the conclusion we saw here:Positives:
+ Drogon - Drogon was magnificent in this episode, from the scene in which he rises from his slumber to when he cries out in despair at the death of his mother, Daenerys.+ Tyrion's Discovery of Jamie and Cersei - Peter Dinklage always bring his A game when he is on screen, and this scene was no exception. He conveys his conflicted emotions really well, with the sadness being fueled by frustration as well due to his complicated history with his siblings.+ Jon Slaying Daenerys - This was predictable, but I think it had to ultimately happen. The buildup to this scene was a bit corny, especially involving Tyrion convincing Jon to do the right thing, but I am just glad that this was the outcome of Daenerys, regardless of the quality of the buildup to it.+ Cinematography - The camera work in GoT is always exceptional regardless of the quality of the writing, and I especially liked the view of the burned down Red Keep with the massive Targaryen banner on it.+ Music - I am really gonna miss the incredible music from this series, and it just made Jon's final farewell to Sansa and Arya so much more impactful. Thank you Ramin Djawadi!Negatives:
Bran As King - Bran does not make sense as a ruler of Westeros for multiple reasons. First of all, the Three-Eyed Raven is not supposed to want positions of power and is also not supposed to have emotions. Bran is basically a human body with the soul of a magic tree inside of him. For Bran to act all satisfied about becoming king, and mentioning that this entire plan was supposed to unfold (Dr. Strange anyone?), really conflicts with the premise of his new identity. Second of all, the rationale that Tyrion gave for this to happen was cute, but would definitely not convince the other lords so easily.An Independent North - Sansa asked her newly appointed king and brother for independent rule of the North, and this was granted without any competition or dissent from the other lords. In what world would House Greyjoy or Martell not want independence as well? When Sansa asked for independence, I fully expected the other lords to also fragment the kingdom and de-centralize the power of King's Landing. There is no way Sansa should have been given special treatment without other regions receiving the same.Jon's Forgotten Heritage - I guess we are supposed to forget that Jon is a Targaryen now and is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. In some ways, this makes sense considering Aemon Targaryen took the black and renounced his heritage as well. But that also makes the entire journey of Jon discovering his true identity rather pointless. I am at least glad that Jon finally pet his puppy Ghost and reunited with his bro Tormund.Rushed Storyline - Overall, it was a really poor decision by the writers D&D to decide on shortened seasons considering HBO let them have full-length seasons like what we got in S1-6. More episodes would have helped this show immensely, especially concerning Dany's unjustified descent into madness. The writers just wanted to get started on Star Wars I guess, which is ironic because I might not end up watching their Star Wars movies after what happened to Game of Thrones.Overall, this episode wrapped up some storylines well enough but also completely gave up on many others for the sake of a quick and convenient ending. The production value of the show holds it up (special effects, music, cinematography), which is why I can't in good conscience give this episode a 1/10 or another score so extreme. A 5/10 feels right, which communicates that the show is right in the middle. On one hand, the production is stellar, but on the other, the writing has become abysmal.Also, looks like someone forgot a water bottle behind Samwell Tarly's foot in the council scene! I wonder if Dasani sponsored this one instead of Starbucks.",5,20 May 2019,1,2
6089,"I don't know why the d&f make the best historical tv series ever like that, you beet to be shame on yourself",2,20 May 2019,1,2
6090,"It was JUST TOO RUSHED. Many things don't make sense and maybe that's why a lot of the ending feels so undeserved and out of the blue.Take the crowning of Bran scene. Sansa proclaims independence. Shouldn't the others all want independence, too? Yet all meekly nod their heads. What?! And Bran veers from this ALL-seeing, ALL-knowing guy from one episode to TOTALLY USELESS in another episode. And just a few words from Tyrion, all meekly agree?Take Mad Dany. I think D&D is confused about the definition of mad. The mad king was ""mental asylum lunatic"". He laughed when burning people. Was Dany laughing when she burned people? Did she go HA HA HA riding her dragon burning down king's landing? No. OK, so another definition of mad is angry. I can accept Dany is raging inside, seeing her best friend beheaded. But the focus of her rage is the Red Keep. When people are angry to the point of insanity, they have tunnel vision, focused solely on destroying their enemy. So instead of Dany flying straight to the red keep out of sheer rage, she decides to.... fly around burn random people? What?! Is she cruel like Joffrey, who takes pleasure in hurting people for no reason? Many talk about 'foreshadowing"" Mad Dany i.e. how she crucified the masters. That is NOT lunacy or cruelty. That is ruthlessness. It makes sense, even if you disagree morally. So which ""mad"" is Mad Dany? Lunatic? Angry? Cruel? Ruthless? D&D rendered her into a confusing mess.Take Tyrion. We've come to love him as a cunning and irresponsible rascal but with a good heart. But in season 8. he's suddenly this Saint who cares so much about the innocents? He's not evil, sure, but there's a big difference between normal people with good hearts, and Mother Teresa. He defended the city during Blackwater but his motivations are hardly about ""protecting the innocents"". His character veers from cunning and witty to sheer stupid to ""save the innocents!"", just to give voice to the storyline or as sounding board for Dany to be ""mad"".Night King was a big joke. No one seen them for thousands of years and defeated in one night by a superhero jumping out of nowhere. Season 8 is a mess. Nice big fights and big explosions. But did we ask for that? Special effects should not take over good story telling. Were there big explosions in Season 1? No, yet it was the meticulous story telling and world building in season 1 that got us hooked.D&D found success on the back of GRRM's amazing imagination, and now that success has made them arrogant to the point of sloppy writing.

6108,"... I think most of the Reviews forget about that.
After episode 5, I said I can not rate this episode until I've seen episode 6. And if I'm honest, Daenarys was never the radiant queen, so the hero queen to which the fan base has made her. She has always been unscrupulous and power hungry, and were there not been her advisors, we would have experienced these Daenarys much earlier in all her cruelty. So it's logical that she behaves the way she did in episode 5. And Jon was the last possible one who got close enough to her to do what had to be done. This ending is a good ending, I do not know how they could have done better and all the negative reviews especially on Imdb are all from Daenary worshipers who just do not want to realize that she was not the heroine queen. For my part, I'm very happy with this end and look forward to the next series coming.",4,20 May 2019,1,2

6112,"The night king and the army of the dead - a threat lurking and growing and killing for 7 seasons - ended in one episode. Underwhelming.Cersei - a complex, cruel, brilliant character; left with no development for the last season, no tricks like she always has up her sleeve, useless and crushed beneath rocks. Underwhelming.Dany - a girl, a princess, a Khaleesi, a breaker of chains, a woman of compassion and justice for the small people, a queen and a ruler, a broken woman, lost and alone in the world, with nothing left but an army and a dragon. A mad queen - rushed into a role without the slow, detailed, development we have seen for so many years. Dead by her lover hands. Underwhelming.I am heart broken - it may have just been a show to some - but Game of Thrones has meant a great deal to me.Throughout the years I have rewatched this show 7 or 8 time - everytime I cheer, I weep, I sob and so much more, my heart has beaten so fast I felt like I might die for 7 seasons. In season 5, Jon's death left me sobbing for hours afterwards and for over a year (and even now still) my poor friends were forced to listen to my tirades about the night's watch and how they could have betrayed him.THIS season however, I have felt minimal amounts of emotions: My heart actually beat dangerously fast in the first minutes of the first episodes, but bit by bit, I noticed that something was missing. And now, my Queen, whom I have loved and followed and cried for for nearly a decade is killed tragically by my other favorite character - the man she loves, as she loves him. In theory, this should have left me an emotional mess for days. But what happened? I felt close to nothing, not even a single tear was shed. This is quite a big deal for me (I become an emotional wreck while watching or reading fiction). When I am left with nothing but an empty, disappointed feeling after watching this and the finale of a show that may have been one of the biggest parts of my life for years, something crucial is missing.The writing this season (and arguably season 7 as well) are lacking complexity, logic, suspense and emotion that used to make GOT the best show in the whole world. The show that always left me breathless and filled me with an intense passion.The complexity, quality, amazing and thorough character development, beautiful dialogue and a plot build-up like no other is gone. The Mad Queen storyline was something I had looked forward to, seeing the heartbreaking demise of my queen after she has lost everything and then a slow deterioration of her sanity - but what did we get? 2-3 episodes rushing her into this role, and when she actually is the Mad Queen, she dies almost instantly - we didn't truly get to experience her as a villain. Dany has villain could have easily been a whole season - a season where we would watch the ones we love fight each other and die at each other's hands. But no, let's finish this so we can do other projects - right D&D?",2,20 May 2019,1,2

They're choice for the new king was so poorly brought up, so random, I almost felt uncomfortable. They didn't even bother showing him in the last couple minutes of the episode. We saw what was coming next for Jon, Sansa, Arya, but not Bran. Seeing him on a throne at least, with people by his side, ravens flying high, something... you're trying to sell us that he's the king now, at least try a bit to make us believe it.

1) did jon snow not know that he is the LAST Targaryen? Didnt it bother him that his house will go exinct when he dies because he cant have descendants as long as he gards the wall for no reason?
2) was the message of this series all along : let me introduce you to democracy, but first let me burn hal of your country to the ground?"" Is that what we waited for for 2 years? Is this a funking joke?
3) wasnt Gendry supposed to be the truthful heir to the throne, being that he is the last of house Berathion, especially that he would be popular because his father was relinquent in killing all the Targaryens to the last one because he know what they re made of.
4) Stupid treasonous Sansa as the ""queen"" in the North?? What the heck? Is this a joke? Is this Disney?
5) what's the point of creating Malisandre? Just to torch the wood and die? Why did she stand with Stannis if she was meant to help people terminating the night king? Did she has hope that Stannis would ignore the throne and turn towards the army of the dead? She was a hard number in the equation of westeros, but they decided to kill her off like that just because it's easier.

If only they have let their characters do what they were supposed to do: John and Bran fight the Night King, Daenerys break the wheel, Arya be a useful faceless assassin, and so on.The worst:""Bran the Broken"" hahaha. Really? Really??? Bran was supposed to be the magician, the ""witch"" that helped humans against the Night King. His role was to be the ""3 eyed raven"" ... whatever that was! It's like as if at the end of LOTR instead of Aragorn they offered the crown to Gandalf. Absolutely ridiculous!The council. The only thing realistic in that council is what Sansa did. After an empire is broken, small kingdoms appear. All of them should have decided to be independent. There is no reason to keep having a king or queen, after everything that has happened! And why a council? To have all these characters reunited? (Fanservice?) Grey Worm should have gone berserk and killed Jon and Tyrion after finding out what happened to Daenerys!Drogon. It finds its mother dead and it destroys the throne. Why??? Why didn't it kill Jon? (Plot armour?) Are dragons now intelligent creatures? (more intelligent than some humans in this show, for sure)The Unsullied and the Dohraki. They procreate at highly speed. They were almost anniquilated at episode 3 (for shock purposes) and now they are thousands again (why are the showrunners tend to forget everything they have previously established????). And WHY didn't they start going on a rampage after Jon killed Daenerys? Why are they so diplomatic now? One second they are blindly following Daenerys and now they are obeying a council??? It's OUT of character!!!!Michael Sapochnick's conception of Arya and the white horse at the end of 8x05 hasn't had, of course, continuity in this episode.The freefolk. Waiting for Jon to go back to their home. Didn't they know there was a HOLE in the wall?There are so many things bad done I could go on forever. I won't even talk about Daenerys (making her a morally ambiguous character is not a bad idea but if she is mad or not it should have been something for us to decide, an open ending should have been more appealing) or the Night King (I can't get off my head the idea that he should have been the MAIN conflict in this season.

Strange attitude when they're moving on to Star Wars.Given that, I'd have preferred if they shortened last week's episode a little and simply added a short epilogue to that episode as the ending. This was just long, boring and a little incoherent.Tyrion as Kingmaker and Bran as king? Tyrion has been written as a dud for 5/6 seasons. Did apathetic Bran orchestrate his rise to power? King Bran - who doesn't make decisions? No issue among the council that Starks rule North and South? No one else looking for independence? Bron - why? 1001 other poor choices made could be highlighted.Unlike 'The Plot to Capture the Wight' and 'The Death of Rhaegal', which while ridiculous, were used to moved the plot along, the choices made during the final 40 minutes and their execution will be remembered as the worst Game of Thrones had to offer. It bears no resemblance to its early years. Strangely it would have been more satisfying had Jon Snow simply burned.",5,20 May 2019,1,2

After that, I decided to wait until the end of the series to buy the complete set.Thank God for that because I will not be re-watching any GOT episode knowing how everything ended.Everything up to episode 5, ok, not happy but understand they have to make lot of things happen in a short time. But Bran Stark becoming the king of 7 kingdom? What? The Bran who emotionlessly told Meera Reed to go home after everything she has done and her brother died for Bran? The Bran who doesn't want to become the lord of Winterfield and all of the sudden he goes yay, I will be the ruler of the 7 Kingdom?Oh and all the lords just ignore the cripple in front the them and believe in the fantasy tale Tyrion told? Yeah we've seen the series and we know what Bran can do, but the other lords are just going to believe Bran can fly because Tyrion said so? I mean beside the Stark family, how many of those lords have heard of Bran's name not to mention what he has done or is capable of doing?And then Sansa just come up and say yo I am not gonna bend the knee even to my own brother, I am gonna be my own queen and rule my own kingdom. And not one lord has something to say about that?This has nothing to do with me loving Bran the character or not, this ending is just utterly illogical and treating audiences like bunch of idiot to accept any trash they've written.So I will not be buying any of GOT Blu-ray or watching any of the spin off.Still, I want to thank the actor/actress for the great acting.

I think you didn't get a say in the TV adaptation but at least finish your books convincingly. I will still remember this series as the greatest show of all time inspite of all this.

Jon got punished big time. Bran secures his seat by sending the ONLY legitimate heir away.No, whole season 8... Disaster, failure, rashly decisions and deaths.Jon or Mad Queen should be on the Iron Throne. They gave the fights. They won the fights.
What did Bran do.. Sits and dreaming.Directors blew it big time.What did we see in s8?
6 episodes.. 2 were the wars.. In one episode, a dragon dies from 3 arrows from a ship no one saw, too many small talks with no essential meaning..Decision for new king in a 5 minute scene for Christ's Sakes..
Tyrion gives a speech for suggesting king, he didnt mention Jon's real identity.
2 sisters and a brother there, they speak.. None of them says Jon's true identity..

6226,"Very rarely does a TV show give an ending the fans deserve or one that impresses all parties, GOT season finale impresses no one and anyone who thinks it was a good ending or a deserved one is clearly paid by HBO to say so. GOT has been on a steep downhill decline since arguably Season 5 with the odd good moment here and there, but Season 8 was a gigantic slap in the face for the fans, from zero character development to ruining 8 season long story arcs with a knife to the belly. The finale for Game of Thrones was a boring, horribly drawn out pile of garbage that could have really been done in about 20 minutes instead of the tedious hour or so we were presented. While I don't mind Bran being made King or Bronn becoming Master of Coin with Tyrion paying his debt to him, certain things really made me say ""Just why?"" namely Sansa being an absolute idiot and claiming independence on the basis that ""The North is broken and will never kneel"", with her country in ruins and half it's people dead it would logically need support from the other 6 kingdoms, Sansa's ascent to the Throne of the North was just an unnecessary power grab and a statement from D&D saying ""Women can do it to.""

Others remained kind of forced: e.g. Jon Snow going again to the Night's Watch and Sansa trying to get a portion of the cake and no one opposing.So now the six kingdoms are ruled by a Stark, and the North is ruled by another Stark. That doesn't make any sense, but was the only idea the showrunners had in mind to give an end.Probably the fact that they were too skeptical with the possible leakings didn't allow the writers to be aware of the fact that the script they had written was crap.

6267,"I know so many people hated the last season and believe me the Dany story arc was bad but I've been disliking her from a bit longer than just the final season but overall this episode was a great ending to the show and I've alwas had predictions as to how it would end:
*Daenerys will die
*Sansa ends up on the iron throne
*Tyrion ends up on the iron throne (maybe marrying Sansa)
*and a few others
From the moment Daenerys set foot in Westeros, I knew she was going to die because it was too good to be true for her to get what she wants. It is Game of Thrones after all.
And I kept tellling one of my good friends that I wished Sansa would end up on the iron throne and in the final episode I actually thought Tyrion was talking about her instead of Bran at the gathering but although my prediction was wrong, it wasn't entirely wrong because she did end up becoming queen, just not of the seven kingdoms.
Tyrion also sort of got a happy ending while serving Bran.
I am by the way very interested in what Arya is going to find west of Westeros (probably America 😂) and I was wondering if Gendry was with her because that wasn't really shown.
And I loved how they incorporated the actual book into the finale. I always had this kind of feeling that it would turn out that all of the things that happened during the show were in a book or something like that (one prediction I sort of got right)But overall, I loved Game of Thrones throughout its 8 season run and the cast, crew and George did a wonderful job.

It was such a perfect ending I am shocked at the hate I see on some reviews and the low rating for the finale!
Thank you D&D !!!!!!! GREAT finale! Bravo!!!!!",10,21 May 2019,9,53

Decent episode but Not Game Of thrones level ending , but fine. Settled way too much .",1,20 May 2019,9,54

6282,I fell in love with this show a few years ago. I was so excited for the final season but I was especially excited to see how it ended. This isn't what we wanted but it doesn't make it a bad episode. It was still an outstanding episode. As someone who is a fan I understand it's hard to get past the fact that it isn't what we wanted but it was still a great episode but it shouldn't have been the series finale.,5,27 June 2019,4,18
6283,"This is my first written review on IMDb. I'm giving this episode 10/10 because I am a hopeless romantic and deeply saddened by the fact that this show has ended. Season 8 was not bad plotwise; in fact it had nice twists in accordance with GoT element of surprise. BUT although it would have been a really good story to read, it did not deliver on screen. I was not enjoying what I was watching. I was glad to see justice served with Cersei's death (she always thought she could outsmart everyone, yet she died like a commoner), but the directing made it difficult to feel the pain of Kings Landing destruction. As far as Daenerys is concerned, she was always my favourite character. I liked the idea of her going mad, she had shown that she was merciless in the past. But it all happened so quickly on screen. So rushed. And her death did not do her justice. Of course she had to die, but it felt fake and predictable. It should have been heartbreaking. We spent 8 seasons loving that character, it should have been devastating to watch her die, not awkward. One scene I especially enjoyed was Jon going north to live as an outcast as he has always been. I liked D&D's ideas in general and I could see their point of view, but like I said, as a viewer I could not enjoy what I was watching. Still. Best series ever. Thank you for 8 magnificent and mesmerising seasons.
We shall never see the likes of it again",10,26 May 2019,4,18
6284,"The frustrating thing about this episode is what sums up the whole of season 8. It is painfully obvious which elements George RR Martin gave to the writers and where they had to fill the gaps (with very cheap filler). The ending makes sense with Bran that was obviously a George RR Martin direction as was Dany going full Mad Queen. But the delivery was painful, why rush it? Why charge through dispatching the Night King? Why have Dany go from showing signs of erraticness to going full Mad Queen in an episode and then dispatch of her half an episode later. That story line didn't even have the chance for us to buy into it before it was finished.Secondary character stories (Bronn, Jamie, Brienne etc) are very obviously just an afterthought and a botch job to wrap up their character arcs which individually had so much intrigue.The ending makes perfect sense (for the most part....members of the small council are slightly questionable) but the stumbling, clumsy finish to the journey leaves a bitter taste that is hard to get rid of.",6,23 May 2019,4,18

I hope the new show becomes good",1,21 May 2019,4,18
6287,"Yup, swimming against the tide here. Upon first viewing i hated episode 5 having felt the series was going steadily downhill, but I found the last episode more enjoyable than i hoped.Cersei was finally exposed as an empty thug, dying in ignimony after all her bluster with Jamie who ended up sacrificing all for the ultimate doomed love. Jon and Tyrion finally saw Daenerys for what she had become. Not mad, but completely delusional.As much as I disliked it I now feel Episode 5 had to happen the way it did to not only provide true meaningless horror but also the ultimate reason for Jon to kill his love. There was no other way.Jon ending up at the Wall had a certain karma to it, Sansa ruling the north had a feeling of Elizabeth I about it. I loved the way Tyrion's meeting of the small council descended into pointless bickering, as life must truly return to normality.I wasn't so keen on Greyworm's ending, nor Arya's. Arya in particular felt like a spin-off waiting to happen.But no, on the whole i enjoyed it.",8,20 May 2019,4,18
6288,Don't really understand all the reviews giving it 1/10. Imo it was the best episode of the season. All the right stuff was there it just needed the build up of 2 10 episode seasons before it.,7,20 May 2019,4,18

6291,"The only things I didn't really like were Bran becoming king, because I never really liked 3 eyed raven Bran at all. His character felt brain dead and useless. The only reason he even existed was to tell Jon about his heritage, which leads into the second thing I didn't like. They really did nothing with that reveal. I mean NOTHING. All it was used for was to piss Dany off and they could have used anything for that. But besides all that, I really enjoyed the episode. I felt it ended each characters story in a great way",9,25 May 2019,7,39
6293,Shows are to entertain. I was thourghoully entertained throughout 1st to this episode. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen and dont feel in anyway it was a disappointment,10,20 May 2019,7,39
6294,I was not having any hope after five episodes and totally it came true sad that it went to be a worst ending for great show really bad. Little emotion was present which made me to cry 😭 so I gave it 6/10,6,14 April 2020,3,12
6295,"Do any of us know how it should have ended, really? If the series is based on medieval times, then the story ended like most medieval monarch dynasties ended; minus the dragon of course. Did I want to see Queen Dani and King John ride off into the sunset on the back of a dragon and make incestual babies? Well, yeah. But we all know that would have gone south. So it ended the only way it could have. John went north, red got a throne, Aria got a boat, and Tyrion didn't die. Win, win. I mean, the powers to be already set us up to roll our eyes at Dani from Season 8 episode 1, so her fate was anticlimactic. What would have been great, is when Dani's BFF got her head cut off that a dragon threw up Cersei and ate her like the dragon in Shrek ate Lord Farquaad. Series over, the end. Now, that would have been something to stand up and clap for!",5,26 May 2019,3,12
6296,"I think the best way that this could've ended would have been the Jon killing Dany scene. They should have spent more time on their relationship and how she will move forward leading up to the drastic discussion for Jon. Everything after that was rushed, boring, and way to easy for what got is used to. Idk about everyone else but I like shows and movies that end with some questions, not force a ""happy"" ending for all, cause that's life.",4,23 May 2019,3,12

6299,"Khalisi had such good character development but in the last season she suddenly embodies the mad king. Jhon Snow was a Targarian and rightful heir to the throne, for no reason, Bran Stark became 3-eyed raven for no reason.Just think about people who tattooed Khalisi on their body, they respected the morals that this character had. You just don't change a character's character. You can evolve a character's character to be better version of themselves. Just Imagine if Naruto who's tag phrase is ""never give up"" someday says ""no I can't do this, no,no,no, I am to week for this"" and just completely gives up on moving forward in life.Dan and Dave, you destroyed Game of Thrones for Star Wars.

6300,Difficult to say anything but WTF? It's incredible the negative masterpiece these guys have accomplished... literally throw away a wonderful universe in just six steps!,2,21 May 2019,3,12
6301,I think this must be my favorite episode of the season. Of course the writing for the last episode sucked but this one really made up for it. Every Character got kind of his logical destiny and the decision to make Bran King actualy makes a lot of sense. He is the wisest man in the seven kingdoms and can watch over everything at the same time too. Really enjoyed Jon's ending too. He's back in the north with his buddy Tormund and he finally got to pet ghost thats all I wanted,9,20 May 2019,3,12

Please dont watch the last season ....",1,20 May 2019,3,12

6304,"This season was rushed and would have benefited from two more development episodes to explain some of the characters shifts in motivation (Daenerys - altho tbf shes been tyrannical for a few seasons now and lets face it, the girls had alot of trauma in her life to get twisted about). However, it was still a great end and anyone giving it a 1 star is letting down the whole programme and us fans with pettiness and venom. Very unforgiving of them and purely to bring down the rating and ""have their say"". Well guess what? You dont have a say. You didnt create it nor did you put all the hours and money into it. You're owed nothing but the story that the writers have given us. I doubt anything would have pleased these people. I agree with so many of the disappointments and negative feedback comments but in no world is any episode under a 7 and only then, when compared to the stand out eps of the earlier seasons. Loved how they ended and left the characters. New adventures for all for us just to be safe in the knowledge of.",9,20 May 2019,3,12

6307,"Everyone got what they deserved and intimately what they wanted. The Starks dominated and everyone wanted that! That was fair! That was justice! For 7 seasons evil was in charge. Enough! It was time for Starks to rule the world! Regarding the characters, we can analyze each one as the directors created them episode by episode:Drogon: Who doesn't believe that he is the reincarnation of the well known leader of Dothraki, Khal Drogo? We all remember his reaction in one of the last love scenes of Jon with Dany in the 1st episode of the last season. He was clearly full of anger and jealousy. As for the last episode, it was awesome, how much perception he could have destroying what actually damaged Khaleesi's mind. The Throne, forged by a dragon and broken by a dragon. Not Jon. He knew Jon was not responsible for her ending, but the throne only. What an epic scene. And of course there was nothing left to do than getting her and disappear!Daenerys: We can all understand there was no mercy in her eyes from the first season. Like Tyrion said, ""she was only killing the bad guys!"" Unfortunately after the death of her own people there was no turning back. Farewell Khaleesi...Jon: We all new from the beginning that he belonged beyond the wall! He said it! He didn't want the 7 Kingdoms and he didn't fight for the 7 Kingdoms! He fought for humanity! If it wasn't him, there would be no war and the Knight King would have been sitting on the Throne! He came from the dead to unite all the people! Not to kill Khaleesi! He came from the dead to win the Great War! Hail to the King Beyond the Wall!Bran: Since he became the Raven, we were waiting for him to do something! Basically in the last season he was useless but i had to see the last episode to change my mind about Bran the Broken. He always knew what was going to happen to everyone, but he couldn't do anything more than giving them only a piece of advice. It will be risky if he could have said more. He could have changed the future and that would be wrong. I consider him the most suitable King. Wise, calm with the most objective judgment! Well done Bran! We really saw you in that ""chair""...Sansa: Like mother like daughter! The best queen of the North ever! When you survive in such a difficult circumstances, you get tougher and stronger as a character! Of course, Sansa with her intelligence made the difference! She fought with her demons and she succeeded. Heil Sansa, Queen of the North!Arya: Arya Rocks! A for Arya! Arya for the win! I am speechless! She is the best! She was always in the right place the right time! If it wasn't her and Needle, everyone would be dead in the 3rd episode! She also did the best for her! Exploring the new world! Hail Arya, Queen of the new world!Tyrion: Respect! One of the BEST characters of GOT! He may have disappointed us for a while, but once again he made us proud with his presence in the last episode! One of the smartest characters that required to stay alive!",10,25 May 2019,8,47

6315,"Did the eighth season bring disappointment to me? Yeah sure it did, but then again expectations were maybe too high?Im fully aware that this season has issues with plot holes, deux ex machina-moments and so forth but c'mon guys....it seems in these times that you either run around throwing flowers and worshipping something or you absolutely completely hate it, loathe it and badmouth it.So now it appears that the trend now, is to be the one hating this season most. Maybe you should try and step back a minute and look at the whole season. Could it have been more refined and would a few more episodes have helped? perhaps...maybe but still...to throw the season to the wolves like that is just dead wrong in my opinion.",8,23 May 2019,8,48

Stunning cinematography, beautiful musical score, great acting and every character getting a poetic ending tied to their true selves. What more do people want? Of course a few things will be rushed due to the few episodes and running time of this season. If you haven't noticed Dany hinting mad king vibes then you haven't payed much attention. Also of course there isn't a Night's watch, Jon was sent there because the North has always been his true home and where every inhabitant saw him as a true king- it wasn't a punishment. The show began with the Starks, ended with Starks. It began with the Night's watch and ended with a new kind of Night's watch. Gimme a break people! They tied the knot completely, the characters who deserved to be somwhere got to be there at the end. The showmakers really payed tribute to it's whole fandom and all the seasons as well, in my opinion. Come back with something new to tell!",9,23 May 2019,8,49

Surprisingly, it wasn't that dark - I liked the bits of humour, which reminded me of the ""good old Game of Thrones"" that we all loved.

6331,"I will skip everything related to fans's disspointment of the finale season. I love the show anyway. And some people argue that Tyrion's speech is senseless. ""What unites people? Army? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. and who has a better story than Bran ?Of course, in the modern world and by audience's standards, many of Game Of Thrones characters have better stories. That's why we love the show. That's why we love Arya, Sansa, Tyrion, Jaime, Dany, Jon Snow, even Cersei at some point.But in the context of Westeros, their stories are the-need-to-survive-stories. Everybody in their situations will do any extraordinary thing in order to survive with whatever means and with whatever tricks that they could use (Arya, Tyrion, Sansa, Jon Snow, Jaime, Dany, Bran, etc...you name it). There are only two exceptionals in that context, namely Dany with her three dragons story and Bran with his transformation into Three-eyed-raven. Theirs are extraodinary-superstitious-mythical-legend-worth story.Apart from that, if we have to choose a king. Would you like to be govern by Arya the assasin? She will become a terrible queen with her skill, she will kill anyone that she thinks worth killing, just like Dany. Jon Snow the oathbreaker ? Personally, I will not choose a leader who promise to do one thing and break his promise as soon as he sees an oportunity, even if what he did is in the name of a greater good. Oh no. Jon is good at heart and has the charisma, but he is not strong enough to be a good king. Tyrion the Imp ? People will always like a charismatic leader, and Tyrion has to work very hard to gain respect from other people, so he might be a good king, but he will always be surrounded by people who talk in his back. And let's face it, Dany is dead. Even though Dany was alive, she was too blinded by her power. The only contender is Sansa, but Sansa knows better and knows her limit. North is in her hands, and she knows greed can overpower people's judgment. So she chooses to stick to her own homeland where people love her.Long live Bran the Broken !",10,4 June 2019,5,26

6335,"It's sad to see so many trolls giving this a 1/10 rating. Even if you feel the writing was weaker this season that doesn't justify giving this 1/10. It's silly and immature. What about the acting? Cinematography? Score? I guess that all deserves a 1/10 as well. Just ludicrous.This wasn't perfect, hence the 9/10, however I was very satisfied with this ending. I thought the scene between John & Tyrion as well as Dany & John were really great. After The Bells I figured that John would probably be the one to kill Dany so that didn't surprise overly but the scene was still poignant, especially how Drogon reacted.The remaining of the episode was your typical denouement you find with epic stories, reminded me of the ending of LOTR, in that it shows a little of what happens afterwards with certain characters. I was completely surprised that Bran would be chosen as King...but it actually made sense. After John killed Dany I knew he wouldn't become King, nor did he want it anyway. I always felt Sansa was more concerned about the North than being Queen of the realm. So to be honest I was at a lose but I like the choice of Bran. But all of the Stark's endings felt right but I felt bad for John.I did feel sad that this amazing show is now over and if I have one gripe with this season I feel that a few more episodes would have made certain character developments and plot advancements feel a little less jarring and more fleshed out. I also would have liked more dialogue and insight into what was going through John's head after finding out his true parentage and I do wish they would have had him talk to Dany more...he seemed so quiet after his parentage was revealed to him for the rest of the season.Overall, I really enjoyed this episode and season.

Utter brilliance",6,7 August 2019,6,34
6338,"Was this the best episode ever? No? Did this final season seem rushed? Absolutely.That said, this was a fitting ending to the series. I think they could have taken a little more time to develop, but I am satisfied. If you were paying attention at all, you would know that it wasn't going to end pretty. It was going to end how it ends. Think people... if you didn't read the books you thought that Ned Stark would be the protagonist. Then he lost his head 9 episodes in. Then maybe Rob, and he lost his head. Ok, maybe one of the ""bad guys""... Tywin, Joffrey, Mance, Stannis, all dead. This show was destined to have an ending that was controversial, and it did. Honestly it might have ended more cleanly than it should have.For those that did read the books, you might have figured this out already. The true protagonist and antagonist of the series is The Throne. The throne being destroyed by Drogon was truly the resolution of the series. For that to happen, Dany had to die. Her decent into madness was predictable from the first episode when she stepped into that hot bath. Jon had to know the truth but turn his back on it, and Tyrion had to become the king and abdicate, because that's what he did.The Iron Throne, the ruler of Westeros for over 300 years, is dead. Long live constitutional monarchy!",7,26 May 2019,6,34
6339,"I will say this once more, this season was the worst season of them all in my opinion but it still doesn't deserve 1 star reviews.Sure; everything felt a little bit rushed and it lacked some major character development, talking especially about Danerys.I don't mind that they made her mad or that Jon killed her in this episode ; what I don't like is a feeling I got when he killed her, I felt numb. All because poor character development this season and the ""Mad"" side of Danny that didn't make sense to me. It still bugs me that all of that mystery of who Jon Snow is was for nothing.In the end, his real name Aegon Targaryen didn't mean nothing and he ended up where he started; back at Castle Black.And now about the main thing; the throne! The favorite moment for me was when Drogon burned the Iron Throne and I felt somehow fulfilled; it made me feel like Danerys death wasn't for nothing and that she did what she always wanted to do and that is ""Break the wheel and free world from Tyrants""
Ofcourse her death played major part in it.Now we have Bran as a King!
I can't say I was suprised by this, but I think he will make a good ruller ;after all he is a Three Eyed Raven.I just wish they they shot one more scene with Danny at the end, she deserved that scene; a proper goodbye!",6,22 May 2019,6,34

6341,"While understanding the disappointment from the built up hype of 2 years from many angry fans, the storyline is as good as it gets for a GoT finale.However the execution is far from perfect. The screenplay is muddled and convenient, pacing is extremely rushed, battle strategies laughable, many loose ends left as is and the small council finish was in poor taste.While the journey to reach there was imperfect, the storylines and the character arcs are mostly intact as how GoT set out to be from the first episode.A solid finish to a game changing TV series which is known for its cinematic production values and shock twists.",9,22 May 2019,8,50

So many bad things happen throughout the series, but that´s ok, because one expects that many of those things will be made right in the end. But this is just depressing. All the characters you have followed and routed for, ends up dead or with loveless lives. I doubt i will watch the series again, knowing how it ends.

6348,"It's hard to accurately capture the pure disappointment I feel regarding this episode- & Season 8 as a whole- with words, but I'll give it a try.
David Benioff & Dan Weiss proved- beyond a shadow of a doubt- that they stopped caring about the fans long ago. Their narcissism clearly got the best of them & they began thinking that they were above reproach. Within the last 3 seasons, we warned them that they were on track to ruining our beloved series, but they covered their eyes & ears in the vein of a toddler who thinks they know better.This episode didn't even seem to know what it wanted to be. Scenes were drawn out with no real reason why.... there were plot holes everywhere with seemingly no effort to cover them.... everything just felt anticlimactic & frankly, sad. The one upside to this episode is the way the Stark name will carry on. There will be a Stark (including Jon) ruling, in some capacity, everywhere in Westeros & beyond. I think Ned would be proud of his kids. However, that's where my love for the episode begins & ends.We (the majority of fans) just gave 9 years of our lives to arguably the best television series ever made only to have our hearts broken this season by D&D because they were in such a rush to end the series & begin their new venture ('Star Wars'). I appreciate the wonderful world that they did give us prior to this, but it's dissapointing that they failed to stick the landing.",4,21 May 2019,2,7

6352,"Game of Thrones was never meant to be what people wanted so it was never meant to have the ending that people wanted. It killed its main protagonist in Episode 9 of the first season. It killed countless other characters that we liked so I don't understand why people expected a ""pretty"" ending. That would have not done the show justice.In Game of Thrones, every action has consequences. Everyone who made a mistake was punished for it. So, if you come to think of it episodes 5 and 6 of season 8 fulfilled this and Dany's downfall was hinted way before this.Bran is the most suited to lead the realm. He is wise, he possesses knowledge on anything, he has no lust for power and he hasn't killed anyone (as far as I remember). Jon on the other hand hanged a boy and ultimately killed the woman he loved. I know, it would have been more satisfying to have Jon sit on the iron throne. But so predictable after episode 5. And this show was anything but predictable.I only wish they touched more on Jon's heritage in the last episode and close that arc.The 9/10 rating is because this episode felt rushed just like the last two seasons. I don't necessarily blame the writing, because there's not much you can do in 13 episodes (the last two seasons). But I guess Star Wars is more important for some people.If we had 10 seasons out of which we had 2-3 seasons on character involution for Daenerys, the story would have made more sense. But then again, everyone would have expected the King Landing massacre. If we had a season for Jon to ponder killing Daenerys instead of a dialogue scene and a walk to the throne room, it would have been more satisfying, but also very predictable. It we had a few episodes on the aftermath and deciding the new king instead of a 2 weeks time jump and a gathering, people might have accepted it easier, but it might have also been boring. So it's a sword with two blades.I also think this is the ending that George R.R. Martin intended, but with much less details in the show. The last book was initially supposed to be called ""A Time for Wolves"" which could indicate the ending.Yes, this season was not everyone's cup of tea, but it was also surprising and I thing it got an ending fitting for what the show was from the beginning. I only wish it stretched over 10 seasons. That would have made a lot of people happy.The production, the visuals, the acting, the costumes, the locations - 10/10",9,20 May 2019,2,7
6353,"Altough Not the ending you expect and Not the ending everyone deserves. It is A good ending. The ending feels disapointing. For two reasons. 1. The show gives you the hope for 9 years that the ending might be A happy end for the characters who are destined to end up on the iron throne. And when it Doesn't happen it feels like injustice.
2. This season is going way to fast to expirience game of thrones as we should expirience game of thrones. There should have been more depth in danaerys turning into a mad queen.
That being said. The ending could not been more perfect, because a dreamy happy end is Not the way of game of thrones. In the end most characters end up in a place where their hart is, and Not were they belong.",9,20 May 2019,2,7

Even potential great moments like the discussions of choosing a king or the small council felt hollow, A random small council by Tywin would davistat these moments. Those were supposed to be great moments but there was a lot missing shots and scenes that needed to build up these moments.

It also left a lot of questions and didn't make a lot of sense at times. I really wanted to see Drogon burn Jon and Jon live through it, or at least something cool.

Martin never wrote about redemption or justice, his point was tale of life and legend and, as shown in the last episode, how present becomes a legens and a myth.

season 8 was, compared to the other seasons, utterly disappointing.

I thought I had it all figured out before I watched this episode - I only had part of my guess right, the rest of it was wrong.Without ruining the ending: I can say I'm not disappointed in who ends up being crowned for the Iron Throne but I really thought someone else was going to get it.It's not the greatest of episodes but it's not all that bad. I'll admit the last season felt rushed as if they were trying to hurry up and end the series, yet they had 2 years to film it. Over all, I'm not that disappointed with Season 8 but I do wish more was added to it and it felt slower.All this mess over Robert Baratheon. He fell in love with Lyanna Stark - she told him NO because he already had bastard children all over - he would have cheated on her too. She met Rhaegar Targaryen - Robert got jealous and started the rumors that Rhaegar had abducted Laynna (untrue she left willingly to be with Rhaegar) -- all that led to Robert's rebellion which lead us into the reason for the story: Democracy is now the order of Westeros - it has become a Democratic Oligarchy (still run by a small group of people, but who runs the 7 Kingdoms is now voted on.

6381,"Maybe if the previous episodes did not lower my expectations to pretty much zero I would be one of the angry crowd, but after finishing this last episode I find myself strangely satisfied.I liked how Dany went in to full tyrant mode being absolutely sure she did the right thing and doing her little warmonger speech. I like that Jon was eventually the one who ended her tyranny and not Arya.I LOVED that the dragon burned the Iron Throne when he found Dany dead. Some people are floating the idea that it was just burning in a random direction, but they forget that dragons are very intelligent (a fact that was stated several times) and it is not too much of a stretch to think that the dragon knew the throne was a symbol that made Dany go mad because she coveted it beyond all reason. The dragon was loyal to her but it knew that what they did to the city was wrong. I feel that Jon and Drogon was kindred spirits in the end. They both loved Dany, but they both accepted that such an end was inevitable.I enjoyed or at least could tolerate the endings for most of the named characters and while some were not perfect, none of them were horribly out of character. Ghost finally got a ""good boy"" pat (better late than never I guess). Bran becoming king is a bit silly, but thinking about it, i don't really have a much better alternative in mind...I just hope he does not end up staying in his room playing Bird Simulator 2000 video games for days on end. Tyrion is much better as an adviser than he would be a ruler and Jon is not king material and will be happier in the north. I liked the new council (Bronn being the master of coins was a bit ironic, but sort of in a good way). There were some attempts at humor which were a tad cringe worthy, but not too bad in general. The dragon and Arya going their separate ways in to the unknown leaves just a bit of mystery but not enough to be an annoying cliffhanger...All in all the road to the last episode was rocky and common sense/good writing were far too frequently brutally victimized, but this last episode was...fine.",7,21 May 2019,3,13

6396,"Disclaimer: This is my personal opinion, so please don't get mad.This ending really ties up a lot of stories. And there is a lot of ends to tie up after such a massive show with so many characters and arcs.A lot of fans are really pissed about this finale and I completely understand why. The true magic of the show was lost during the last two seasons, which I, personally, found very sad. The last two season could easily have been stretched to last for 4-6 seasons, which would keep it true to the rest of the show. D&D really did the show dirty by shortening it to the extend that they did. If the story of the last two seasons were told in the span of 4-6 seasons, it might actually have been way more enjoyable and would have given the viewer the closure we needed. Nonetheless the story ended in a somewhat reasonable way.Every main character's arc was fulfilled. The only arc I feel bad for was Jaime Lannister's, since I think his story was undermined the second he returned to his sister. A lot of people also had a problem with how Dany's story ended. I always disliked her somewhat due to her violence and vengeance, which is why I always found her too driven by her emotions rather than her brain. She was always consumed by the hatred and vengeance, which is no wonder why she went mad. The whole wrapping up of her story arc was rushed, which is why it seemed so unnatural, but it does not take away the fact that this was always her fate. If her transition to madness was portrayed in the span of 4-6 seasons it might have made it more natural.Jon also got exactly what he wanted. He never wanted the throne or the power. He was indeed a simple and honorable man. People fail to realize that sending him to the wall pleased the people, who wanted him dead, and pleased him, since he finally got the freedom he sought out.I have way more to talk about, but I think that these main points are the most important to understanding, why I rated the show as I did.",8,21 March 2021,4,20
6397,"Get the eff over yourselves. How many times did viewers have to be told that there was never going to be a happy ending? For me, this was perfect. It was always about the Starks and they got what they wanted: Jon was truly free from the burden of his name(s); Sansa was a Queen; and Arya was independent. The build up to Dany's fate always indicated to me that she would die at the hand of someone who loved her - I thought it would be Jorah but making it Jon was even better. Drogon burning the Iron Throne was visually and metaphorically brilliant. And while Bran as King was unexpected, it also makes sense.Game of Thrones was a masterpiece of storytelling about war, a hereditary monarchy, religion, love, death, family and it subverted every drama trope there is. My watch will never be over, because i'll be rewatching the best tv show of all time for the rest of my days.",10,25 May 2019,4,20
6398,"The cinematography, acting, score, CGI were all on point as with every episode this season but it does feel very rushed. I was actually expecting 8 episodes this season. I hadn't imagined they were going to wrap up a war against the night king, a war against Cersei and all the aftermath in 6 episodes!!! No wonder the entire thing felt rushed. I wonder if the series had such a following that they didn't bother to space it out. Like some kind of money grab. Or maybe it's getting harder to obtain commitment from the actors for more episodes. Who knows, but they certainly could have milked this a little more and wouldn't have had to sacrifice so much missing in-between story if they had committed to another season or even just a couple more episodes. I wasn't sure why everyone was whinging about the last couple of episodes but this one it's painfully obvious just how rushed it all is to wrap up. Some really fantastic scenes in this episode but I would have liked to see more time spent on the development of the characters and story this season.
It would have been an incredibly difficult task to end the series in a way that satisfies, because of the hype and expectation built.
Really mixed feelings. 🤷‍♀️",6,21 May 2019,4,20

There's no disputing the clear and present fact that too many plot lines were terminated without depth or meaning however as a story the ending was true to the legacy we could all see before us.The Starks triumphed and after giving their service to the 7 kingdoms and losing so much the last of the starks got their happy endings.Arya is off to explore the world.
Sansa got her kingdom in the north
Jon left to become the king beyond the wallAnd bran will continue to do what he's done for 7 seasons......... absolutely nothing!!",8,21 May 2019,4,20
6400,"The final episode started as I expected from watching 'The Bells' last week; Danny was becoming an evil woman bent on controlling the world with her Dothraki and Unsullied army, Tyrion stepped down as Hand of the Queen and John decided she should be stopped.It was fitting that John killed Danny, not Arya as I has suggested in my review of 'The Bells', she had already killed the Knight King so she can't get all the glory. The dragons reaction was unexpected; showing no anger towards John and just flying away with Danny's body.I think it is good how they elected a new King, 'breaking the wheel' as Danny put it, but I didn't expect Bran to be chosen.
He was rather a disappointment, after the big buildup of the three eyed raven, and his apparent lack of action during the battle against the dead army and the Knight King, I was expecting something more from him in the last episode, but nothing came?! But when Tyrion listed his accomplishments he seemed to suggest the 'three eyed raven' was more significant than we've seen.Brans comment at the end about the dragon, ""I'll find him"" that too came to nothing and was a big let down. I did like his new council, but I was surprised to see Bronn, where had he been hiding because last we saw of him was in Winterfell aiming a crossbow at Jamie and Tyrion?Bran's comment to Tyrion when he was suggested as the new King ""why else would I have come"" and later his comment to John ""you were exactly where you were meant to be"" hints at an underlying plot by him to win the crown, but I can't believe that as there's been nothing in the past 8 series' to suggest anything of the sort?
Aryas revelation that she was just going to sail away to the west was a bit of a surprise, but her curiosity was mentioned before in Series 6, and Euron said he has sailed around the world so there has to be SOMETHING there?
Maybe there's a sequel in this? I hope soI expected Sansa to 'bend the knee' to her little brother, but for the girl who wanted to be a Queen since episode 1 it was almost predictable that she'd make the north a separate kingdom.John being sentenced to the Knights Watch was unexpected, why is it necessary now the Army of the Dead is gone? But on consideration it is in a way where he belongs with the 'free folk'It seems a little too predictable that we started Series 1 with the Stark children growing up together in Winterfell, and a couple of deaths aside, we've ended with the Stark children in command everywhere (Bran is King of the 6 Kingdoms, Sansa is Queen of the North, Arya is taking command of the seas, and John is north of the wall (and no doubt he's thier leader given his history with the 'free folk'))But what's happened to the dragon? Where did he take Danny's body? We need answers",8,21 May 2019,4,20
6401,"Have people not been watching. This isn't a fairy tale. Yes I would have liked to see it over more episodes and seasons. But that wasn't to be and it ended as each season started, not with what everyone wanted, but each character got what they deserved. Duty is the death of love. It was D&D's duty not to turn the story into a 'and they all lived happily ever after. Bravo to a wonderful series that I will surely miss but fondly remember.",9,21 May 2019,4,20
6402,"I think I would like to see D&D write a scene regarding a conversation between someone from the horde of fans that hated everything about the last couple seasons of GoT and someone from the opposing side.The casting will be important, because a lot of this is going to need a performer that can use the smallest crevasses on their faces to draw out emotional cues that some might determine as stupid because they aren't directly saying what they are thinking. I'm going nominate Lady Sansa herself, Sophie Turner as the opposition, and Lord Hand Tyrion, Peter Dinklage for the role of the disgruntled and 'disgusted' fan.Even though this is a stupid thought exercise that has only produced a couple chuckles from myself, I think that it is an important thing to remember that this exercise is the closest that I will ever get to writing a GoT scene in my life.George R.R. Martin is getting a pass here, but do we all honestly think that any of this would have happened without his seal of approval? This show meant a lot to large amount of people and we all have the right to discuss what we liked or didn't like, but GRRM, the creator of the universe, gave D&D the keys with a roadmap of his own creation. Has anyone come out and called for him never to produce again? No because he is a creator and he trusted other creators with his most prized possession, and it looks like he doesn't have much of a problem with the finished product.The guy who created the whole f'n universe that we all cherish told the showrunners where the story and characters were headed and we still ripe it apart because it did not perfectly fit our fan fiction version. Doesn't that seem a little odd? A story and the characters that populated it while displaying a tremendous amount of development from when we first saw them until they left us is now the bane of our existence.Some of this criticism is deserved, it wasn't a perfect last few episodes. But to degrade and smash the show runners is an oversimplification if you are angry. Don't just stop there, go after everyone, from Emilia to the production intern. Otherwise take a look at what your saying and tell me it's not just an echo chamber filled with negativity.I'll end with this, that scene from the beginning would probably mention everything from both sides and would probably be impeccably staged with phenomenal dialogue and acting. Don't forget the level of excellence that got us to this point, and don't turn a blind eye to the flashes of excellence within episode 8.6.",8,21 May 2019,4,20

I think the issue is many of the booknerds got spoiled and now they're buttmad, whereas they were going around spoiling the show for everyone for the first few seasons..karma's a B!!!Yes the season was rushed, but did we really need 3 ..4...5 more episodes showing Dany's story?

Bran made it obvious that he was both amoral and ruthless when he used Hodor as fodder to protect himself. In this last episode it is revealed that Bran was plotting to gain the throne himself, and was influencing events to that end.
After the night king was destroyed Bran could quibkly move to gain the throne. He controlled both Jon snow and Daenerys , and thus their unexpected behavior. This was Bran's doing, and in fact, once it was known that he had ambitions for the throne himself, one realizes that there was really no way anyone could stop him, as he could influence people in the past to perform what he wanted in the present. So, again, the transformation we saw in Jon, Daenerys, and other characters was due to Bran. This is made obvious when Bran tells Jon that Jon was exactly where he needed to be when Jon was behaving badly. So, this was actually a great conclusion to the series.",10,24 May 2019,9,63

6416,"I know it seems to be popular to hate on the last couple of seasons of Game of Thrones. Admittedly, season 7 and 8 had plenty of weaknesses, the biggest being the too fast pace, in my opinion.
However, I really enjoyed watching Episode 6 and the ending is appropriate for Game of Thrones. Of course you won´t have a happy democracy in the end, and not everything will be perfect but you can see light at the end of the tunnel.
Bran becoming King is a good ending point for the literal ""game of thrones"" in my opinion as he´s the wisest man in Westeros. Tyrion ending up as his hand as a punishment feels right, as well.Sansa leading the North to independence is nice for the North but I wish they remained in the 7 Kingdoms because to me it felt like Sansa just wanting a crown for herself above all else.Jon ending up back at the Wall is perfect for his character in my opinion. The dutyful ""hero"" won´t have his happy ending resting and enjoying life, but being reunited with Tormund and Ghost at Castle Black and going beyond the wall is something he will be happy about as well. I just found it odd that Bran had the authority to send him back to the Night´s Watch as the Wall is no longer a part of the 6 remaining Kingdoms.Arya going on a new adventure fits her character nicely, as well.",8,20 May 2019,4,21
6417,"Given how the season went, although this could've been perfect as a two season finale to divide the Night King and Daenerys situation, overall this is the ending I've been finding. It's not at all perfect in some ways, like how quick Daenerys' death was considering they rushed this season and Bran getting the crown after he disappeared for a few episodes, For me personally, Jon going back to the north with Ghost and the freefolks, Sansa being the Queen in the North, Bran ruling a democratic Westeros breaking the wheel of the Iron Throne, and also Drogon destroying it was very symbolic of an end of an era and starting anew. Arya going a Magellan route to explore the unknown parts of the world, Greyworm fulfilling his promise to Missandei and go to Naath, it was all sewed nicely with imperfections. You shouldn't give your rating this whole season to a single episode, because this episode was how the show is supposed to end, and they did it nicely. But I do wished there was more time to see the other characters ' arc getting closed. Overall, this was the episode that I was hoping for, the other episode may have sucked in terms of writing and in terms of this whole season being rushed, but this episode, it's all for what it's worth.",9,20 May 2019,4,21

Are you afraid of me"". The wheel has been broken, the North has their independence, and Jon is where he belongs, free and anonymous, with nobody to fight and a future ahead.

You know the saying: ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" And this is exactly what happends. Stop being such children about it and understand this! And to the people that are frustrated by the fact that Night King died, I have this to say:Let's say that the Night King wins the fight in the North. Somewhere around 97% of all interesting people in the series disappear and/or become new undead soldiers in the Night King's army.What happens next? The Night King travels south. The whole thing then becomes a tedious lengthy battle between Cersei and the Night King.
That is probably the most boring thing I can imagine. The series is about a story about intrigue and war between families and nations trying to challenge each other. For this, you need lots of interesting people and places of note.

6450,"The show is being punished for its own success. I mean, it's an ending season. Can you imagine how hard it must be to think of a brilliant ending for a brilliant show? There is no where to hide.
I think the main problem is the change to 6 episodes instead of the usual 10. Although longer episodes, we still lost 8 episodes in seasons 7 and 8, so less time of GoT overall. This made them rush the characters a little bit, I agree. Some needed more buildup, other moments needed more time to be assimilated by the audience. And other moments made no sense, I believe, just to rush the story to the end. Still, I'm not shocked by the way it ended and in no way I agree with the rating bombing that's been going on. You people are wrecking this for future generations. No episode in GoT deserves a 1, if not for the actores, the production and the music. The music is an easy 6!! Think about it guys, a 1 is like the worst show ever... is this really the worse tv show season ever?
Spoiler Alert!!!The ending is a bit sad, so thumbs up for those who don't like happy endings (worth at least a 3?)Jon Snow deserved more. He basically spent his adult life fighting for others, for the greater good, only to not have a single person fight for him. Not even his family. They were all fine with it. A king, a queen and an adventurer. Who cares about Jon, he isn't even our brother... speaking of which, being the true heir to the melted throne meant nothing and wasn't even mentioned in the meeting. Also, the Jon I know wouldn't do what he did. He changes people's minds, he gathers people around him for a cause, he doesn't just kill when in doubt.Danearys needed more buildup and her death needed more impact. After a scene like that with the death of a main character, how can you go directly to a scene with all the survivors in a meeting to choose a king weeks later? We saw no reactions to her death. Not even Jon's reaction. This was a huge negative for me.An independent North doesn't really make sense. Why didn't others, like Dorne do the same. Why would you be a subject when there is an opportunity to be a ruler?Still, I loved following the ""brothers"" walking in different directions.

6453,"There is a greatness behind the concept of Daenerys becoming the Mad Queen.
Granted, this is the kind of ending one would expect from GoT, a series that redefined the concept of plot twists.
But a plot needs a background, and, dear Dan and Dave, we know you know it better than us, because for 7 seasons you delivered: killing off Ned Stark would not carry the gravitas it did, if he had not been painted as the hero of the story. Likewise, Daenerys was depicted as a person of principles.
Without background, plot twists feel dumb: Daenerys turning mad just because of one dragon being killed was not effective. It was not believable. And ultimately, it made no sense.
The way it didn't make sense when Michael Corleone grew a conscience in Godfather III.
You had (I assume in cooperation with George) a good idea for a finale reminiscent of Oedipus and the poetic justice of Greek tragedies. Only some things cannot be rushed.
I will disagree with most people that season 8 was bad. Season 8 had some great ideas. The problem was, it needed build up. It needed the Night King to survive his first battle. Sure, have Arya assassinate him- but BUILD IT UP.
It needed to explain why and how Daenerys descended into madness. Sure, have her become the Mad Queen, it's a really great twist- but BUILD IT UP.
And it most definitely needed a last episode that made even remotely any sense, as everything that happened just felt random and ludicrous.
You had the budget, you most definitely had the viewers and the fans, and you certainly had the time.
The ending could have been bad, and that would be alright.
But it should not be ludicrous.
Which is exactly where you didn't manage expectations: you can't expect the devoted viewers of an intelligent series to acknowledge nonsense for closure.Anyway, the trip was great and i thank your from the bottom of my heart for all these years of excitement.

Of course there was a particularly big one which made it feel awkward, however overall most of the complaints about subversions are undeserved.The level of acting the show portrayed also made up for the decline in writing. People can complain bout writing but there's a reason that some shows with very simplistic plots but excellent actors still perform well.

I read something from the actor who played Bran that George's plan on ending the books is similar to the shows so I am excited to see how Dany was feeling in moments like the execution of Missandei and the burning of Kings Landing as there will be more information to explain how she was feeling.",7,1 June 2019,5,31

Bran's figure left in viewers feeling that all the characters was played by him and he was the main villain at all, using the ladder of chaos. Even Tyrion at last didn't know if he ask Jon to do the right thing.
If you ask me i prefer an happy ending for the Characters Daenerys, Jamie and Cersei.

So, if Jon's dragon didn't wake up from the dead as his master did few sesons earlier, and I didn't get the final epic clash between the brother dragons just to get the winner of the throne as I expected and should be, as far as I'm concern the most logical way to bring it up to the end, I should be dissapointed as well.Loosen up people, even the show eventualy has to end up somehow.

I believe most fans' hatred stems from their own unfulfilled expectations, and not from the way the story ends. Danaerys did not become queen. Jon did not become king. I found it quite fitting that a ""broken"" King took the reign of a broken Westeros. Arya was given the opportunity to do what she always wanted, as was Sansa. Most of the other supporting characters (the ones that survived) found themselves in humble, but appropriate new roles/situations.
If you haven't learned that circumstances don't always work out in the brutal world of Westeros, I would implore you to recall episode ""Baelor"" of season 1, or ""The Rains of Castamere"" from season 3.

We all know D&D were the creators of this series, and even though it was dissapointing, we still have to give them credit for bringing us the best show ever created.

This finale was very philosophical. The discussion that Jon and Tyrion had in the latter's cell was key. The speach about a ""good story"" (or ""idea"") Tyrion gave before saying Bran should be king was just as important.
If you wanted the final glory of this last season to fall into the shoulders of a fighting man, you haven't watched the same series I have.

I give this episode a rating of 7 because it was a good episode in many aspects with a necessary, but okay ending. Not a fantastic ending, but also not a terrible ending.
Something that the entire series has done is make many people question a lot of aspects and occurrences in the show. So why would the ending be any different? Did I want it to end the way it did? In some aspects yes, and in some aspects no. But just because it didn't end the way I wanted it to doesn't mean it was a terrible episode. The acting was beyond amazing, the portrayal of a ruined city was emotional, and it created an open-ended ending, as is life.
I definitely wanted Jon to rule the seven kingdoms, and found it slightly odd that Bran the one who said he couldn't even be a lord of Winterfell was so willing to be king. However, in staying true to his character Jon would not have wanted the throne, so doing everything right did grant him a piece of the life he wanted all along.
I wanted things to end differently but that doesn't mean it was a bad episode.
A good show gives the ending everyone wants to see, but a fantastic & epic show gives an ending that makes you question, think, and discuss it well after it's over.",7,24 May 2019,4,25

But bashing it only because someone had something in their mind and it didn't pan out like that is just disrespectful. The actors did great, specially Peter Dinklage and Kit Harrington. Visually it was wonderful. But the story was definitely rushed and not well told at all. I heard somewhere that HBO wanted to give D&D more episodes but IT WAS THEM who refused, which made me very angry. This was not a story to be told in six episodes. I don't care how long they were, it felt so rushed and even out of place sometimes. I just wanna conclude with saying that please calm down and think again. This is not a 1 or 2 or 3 OR 4 out of 10 ending. Yes, it was below our expectations and that's because our expectations were sky rocketing. We should've known that expecting GRRM type writing from Dumb&Dumber is like a crime in itself.

If that was the case, would they still rate it with a 1 star? I guess not.Anyway. I rate the whole 8th season only with 6 stars because it feels unnecessary rushed to me. Intentially rushed, I assume, as I guess the writers were sacrifying character development, here especially Dani's, for simply shock and surprise effect when she suddenly burned down the city and its people. That was unreasonable, IMO, as with two more episodes they could have layed the ground and given some hints which made the ultimate event much more logical or at least believable. Pity, but I can live with it.",6,21 May 2019,4,25

How could we waste so many years on this?Yes, we are left with an open ending, thanks! But how could it be that the Starks we love have all became trators? They all knew, who Jon was and they had enough force, hadn't they? How could it be that the Jon we respect is a sneaky lying piece of puppet? And where is his army, when he needs it the most, btw?

don't expect some great revelation or twist the last minute. it was very clear where this is moving to from previous episodes. i don't know if this would have been better if the books were already out. maybe the dialogue might been slightly better but apart from that a good ending in general but most people probably hated it. my rating would be a 7.8.",8,21 May 2019,3,17

In that respect, I was pleasantly surprised as the episode had a rather logical ending. It was evident that Dany would die. A mad Queen is no better than a Mad King. I somewhat expected Arya to be the one to deal the blow, but it made more sense that a Targaryen would be able to survive the situation. A dragon would not harm him.There were quite a few errors (gazillion Dothrakis and Unsullied left alive) caused by the previous episodes having such strange decisions by the writers. Episodes 3 & 4 of this season in particular were horrible. It would have made sense to have them surrounded by a larger number of men of the Westeros and Grey Worm to do the math from that.

Bran becoming King would have made more sense if Jon had died, but was a good choice considering he can keep an eye on all the kingdoms. The acting was mostly great, especially peter dinklage.

If Jon did not kill Daenerys, people would massively criticize the latest episode because of the fifth episode, because Denny burned the whole city and killed innocent people who served as the victim of Queen Cercei. To be honest, I expected this end for the reason that at the beginning of the show we meet Daenerys as a warlike young woman eager for war and revenge on father.

Probably it'd have been better to choose any fan theory or fan made ending as even the most outlandish theory would have been a more conclusive ending than exiting Jon and crowning bran who basically didn't do anything.

All the deaths, the twists, the turns kept me on edge continuously and I LOVED it. We all were succumbed to it's unpredictability but the one episode we have spent years waiting for were very poor.
Emilia said she'd have liked to have dissected her character more, more in depth conversations, more on why and how she was spiralling into the dictator she was pushed on us to be.
This episode fell flat on it's face. It is not the acting or the behind the scenes crew that are being slated let's make that clear. The dialogue was diabolical, a lot of silence and repetitive lines we've seen uttered in prior episodes. The endings, as bittersweet as was promised, were not justifiable and as the audience we couldn't empathise or get on board with some characters final feelings.
Sansa being queen of the north is something that could've been elaborated on.

After all that build-up with the enemy beyond the Wall and Jon's unveiling his real potential, the viewers end up with a parody of the humanity's history, when 'Game of Thrones' had always been brilliant in its bringing an original reality to the screen. The audience is ultimately left with a reminder that life takes its normal course, no matter what, when what was really needed was a story free of contemporary context and allusions, thus, worthy of admiration and remembrance up to its very ending.

Even the characters who ""won"" only received hollow, pointless victories. No groundbreaking point was made.

Seriously guys, why kill him then bring him back to life and say that The Lord of Light has bigger plans for him, why make him the true heir to the Iron Throne and have everyone talk about how good of a ruler he'd be just to make him kill the woman he loved. I'm not saying that he should be king after that but you have foreshadowed his greatness and his great destiny since season 6 and now he takes the black and goes to the ""True North"". I guess that he would be able to find happiness there and he belongs in the north but still it seems to me that you have seriously doomed his ending, he was meant for greater things and a greater ending.At least he pets Ghost in the end.It doesn't deserve 1/10 but the writers could have done better.

6655,"I truly liked season 8, episode 5, the Bells. It set up what could have been a proper finale. But clocking in at 1 hour and 20 minutes, the story's climax was nonexistent in GoT's final episode. Yes, season 8 lumbered along, but episodes 3 and 5 were rewarding. In both of those episodes, we saw John Snow moving closer to the Iron Throne. It was the only logical conclusion. But his complete loss of a spine in the final episode was disappointing. And really? Bran as King? And Sansa just gets to keep Winterfell for her own grubby little hands? Filmed versions of books typically differ from its souce book's ending. And I don't know how this story ends in the book (yet), but that's not an excuse to make a much anticipated series ending so reductive. What does the author think? Did he have a hand in this?
There were two scenes that had merit: the mythological treatment of Danerys' body ascending to the heavens, and Brienne finalizing Jaime Lannister's written history. Those two scenes taken in isolation work thematically and cinematically. But that's it. I started watching GoT only this year, via binging the first seven seasons in February and March, so I don't feel the enormous loss and disappointment of all the longtime fans invested in the the story's arc. But apart from the two scenes I noted above, the end of the series was anticlimactic and disappointing.",3,20 May 2019,1,3

All the stories, prophecies and character progression for the past 8 seasons were completely ignored. This whole season feels like some random rushed independent little movies that make no sense and have no continuity or context whatsoever.And the worst thing is that all of it could actually make sense if they did it with proper writing and pacing.

D&D are nothing without GRRM. Can I just give it a zero? No, that would still be a significant number. Was that a prank? Or a joke? Dany just dies and nobody weeps except drogon? Where were the dothrakis? Why lead them to the capital then?
Such a shame. The entire series came to a shameful ending.
Are D&D creating any more shows further? I better not watch them. They're just a waste of time, a piece of crap, and useless.
I can't even type anymore. I involved myself too much in this show, only to receive this stupid ending. It's not game of thrones. It's just a crap. Some cartoon show I believe. No logic, no meaning, nothing.

Also the wall is in the north which is now independent, so does he really have to stay there ? And the unsullied have gone. Dany was the invader at the end of the day and he was the true heir so why is this his ending.Also thinking where were the lords of westoros when Dany was attacking kings landing.

Sansa got the perfect arc for her character, she always wanted to be lady Stark and she got what she wanted.2. Jon got what he always wanted, to be with the love of his life among the free folks. But was denied the perfect arc, had he killed the night's king as he was supposed to, all would've been forgiven. His lack of remorse killing Dany, his second love shows the lack of chemistry with her the show runner denied to allocate more time to develop, as they did with Ygritte. It should have torn him apart to have killed Dany, but the relationship hadn't marinated enough for us to feel his pain.3. Arya's arc was near perfect, had she not been the one to kill the Knight's king but had she mortally wounded Cercei and watched her die in the arms of Jamie who had been mortally wounded by Euron! Then if she had gone on to explore west of Westoroes.4. Dany was doomed the day she was compared to her father, but her arc was snatched from her and they denied her bittersweet end!5. Tyrion, what can I say? less I say the better it is, he too got short end of the stick.6. Bran - His arc was the worst. The set up of going beyond the wall, becoming the three eyed raven coming back with the knowledge of the past, present and the future, him being marked by the knight's king was all for nothing!! He had the worst Arc's among the rest of the main characters. Devoting all the time they did on him and killing off fan favorites like hodor, the reed siblings, children of the forest was all for nothing. NOTHING!!!",6,20 May 2019,1,3
6691,"Sorry, I respect all comments, but if you enjoyed this finale, then you have a terribly bad taste for movies, and TV.
Superficial dialogues, predictable conclusion, boring development, lack of energy, sad arguments, nonsense violence, and superficial rational, this is the finale that the TV writers gave us.
The final episode and the last season in general were terrible bad. It's obvious, the writer's / adaptors ego, overcame George RR Martin advice.
TV writers ego and ambition prevailed, and produced a terrible damage to GOT story, HBO, the fans, RR Martin and HBO TV series. Its evident that was intentional to create the worst scenario possible, and a bad precedent for future HBO productions.
No drama, everything looks like a ridiculous vengeance against HBO, the cast, and RR Martin, someday we will know what happened behind this debacle.

It left me feeling unsatisfied and quite frankly upset knowing that the series had to end this horribly. Not the ending I wanted or the ending the series deserved. This could possibly be one of the worst endings for a series of this magnitude. Not sure what the writers were thinking, but this will let down current and future viewers alike.

they show jon killed dany , great ! But this could be more emotional then what they have showed to us . Dany can be more expressive while dying.
Tyrion pitched for bran to be the king 😁 what a great pitch , he tried to manipulate philosophically.
Why didn't they all named arya to be a king ?
Wth is red women mentioned green eyes to arya
Why jon is not titled queenslayer but title of kingslayer is attached with jamie when he killed tyrant ( mad king)

It was totally preventable, but D&D gave up on this show because of that Star Wars money. And that's disgusting.It makes sense that 2 best episodes of this train wreck season (episode 1 & 2) were not written by D&D - they wrote all the worst ones (3-6). This season will go down in history as one of the worst final seasons ever (it joins Dexter & House of Cards). What an utter failure.

It was the violence, sexual abuse and killing off leading characters that made me stop watching and reading. But I went back to it and I'm now convinced it's one of the best shows I've ever seen. Why? The characters are flawed complex humans who grow, change or remain mired in their own trauma for real human reasons. There is much criticism of Sansa''s response to the Hound about her own journey from spoiled naive ""little bird"" in love with Joffrey to the powerful woman she is now. Trauma and suffering are definitive in character formation. You can either grow and learn from it, becoming a strong compassionate person, or you can remain mired in victimhood for the rest of your life. Sansa chose to learn. The Hound has remained a victim of his brother's cruelty. One of the show's most criticized moments is actually one of its best.",1,20 May 2019,1,3

I also won't mention how it was supposed to be a finale that has it's closures everywhere (yay for Edmure!) but how I'm still missing poor Dario.I will have to mention the small things like Jaime and Cersei dying, little did they know if they stood 5 steps to the right they would have survived the whole collapsing thing. Or other smaller details like Ghost still having fresh wounds and blood on him, while Jon was away for months. I mean he went to King's Landing, spent time in jail, then went back to the Wall, then he greets Ghost and poor wolf still has his battle wounds fresh as hell.But there are bigger and more concerning problems too, like why does Brienne sit in the Council. Didn't she pledge to serve Sansa who is in Winterfell? Then there is Grey Worm, you know the guy who was full of rage and kept killing people in episode 5, you know the same guy who executed the lined up Lannister soldiers with a small knife, because ""they are free man who served Lannisters, why not"". You know the same guy who would have killed Jon with the Unsullied, because Jon intervened in said execution. So how did he go from that, to imprisoning Jon and not straight up killing him, after Dany's death? Did he kinda just forget everything? But let's say this is somehow okay. Then they made Jon join the Night's Watch, just to avoid any chance of conflict with the Unsullied. Who, just as Jon leaves King's Landing, also leave to Naath. So you know, what is up with that? Where is the conflict? Then there is Arya, you know the girl who had her whole character arc about getting back to the family, who now goes ""ayy, what's west from westeros? see you guys!"". I mean okay, I guess. But my biggest issue is with Bran. I know I already said in a previous review, that he will be on the throne. But the way he made it there is just stupid. He said he doesn't want to be a king. Then when it is offered to him he goes ""Well that's why I came here, duh"".Okay I'm not going to name every and all mistakes.

6715,"*SPOILER ALERT*
Don't read if you haven't seen the GoT finaleI see a lot of hate going towards the finale, but I have a theory which I seem to think makes this a fitting finale to a great show.Tyrion won the game of thronesHe always knew he will never be KingTywin had made him realize back in S2/S3 that the real power lies with the hand of the King (back when Tywin was Joffrey's hand)Considering Tyrion's history with Tywin and Cersei, he was never going to become Cersei's hand, and was indeed absconding from WesterosHis best bet to get back into Westeros and into a position of power was to become Dany's hand, which he schemed his way into becoming (using Jorah)He always knew that Dany would be too strong a leader for him to have real power as her hand, so he planned to introduce Jon Snow into the mix. He is instrumental in them meetingOnce the plan has worked and JS and DT are successfully hooked up, you can see Tyrion's plan working by the look on his face at the end of S7He then plans for Dany to lose all her allies one by one, driving her to the typical Targaryen madness. His 'botched up' plans lead to the losing of her marine armiesThrough both his interactions with Cersei in the last 2 seasons, Tyrion goads Cersei into doing things that will anger Dany purely by suggesting the opposite (knowing Cersei will always do the opposite of his recommendation)His plan is to let Dany's madness loose, and then goad Jon into killing her. That way she is dead, and he will no longer have claim to the throne. All the while, Tyrion is standing away from the actual fighting.His main complication emerges when Jon's lineage is discovered. However, he tries to squash it. When he discovers that Varys is trying to tell the world, he has no option but to get him killed else Tyrion's plan failsThe only smart person left is Sansa, who he doesn't want to go up against and lets her have her way and make the North independentHe has been working the Bran angle all season through various conversations and glances, and only a king who doesn't want power will let Tyrion have the true powerTyrion ends up in a room which he carefully sets up as this was his favorite position of power through the seasons, he has Bronne and Pod by his side, and is still considered a good guy in all this. The last joke is that his name is not in the book of the tale, but he is the one who orchestrated it.#gameofthrones #gotfinale",8,22 May 2019,5,36

6719,Whilst I have issues with the pacing of this final series it was far better than some of the ridiculous 1 star reviews posted on here. People need to recognise just because a series doesn't end in the way they see fit doesn't make it crap. Get a life and grow up.,8,28 May 2019,5,37
6721,"I'm amazed how people are giving this 1/10 and namecalling D&D... that for me is disrespectful for this people and the legacy of thrones. At this point is just ridiculous.
I loved the ending.. it wasnt perfect, well life isnt and this game was never perfect or fair for that matter. The Daenerys hardcore fans should just be proud of her. She fullfield her destiny, but she sure wasn't perfect, and she paid for her mistakes too.. when she was good she was very good but when she was evil, nothing would stop her... from the very beggining.
I was thinking about it.. I read a review saying that everyone had a happy ending except Dany but the Starks deserved their happy ending more then anyone in this show.. I actually loved the Starks arc versus the Daenerys arc.. the Starks started losing and dying one after another, and gradually started winning back their place in this world.. on the other hand Daenerys conquered and conquered and conquered with many losses of course, but she sure was always winning everything that she wanted and would keep on doing it until she really turned MAD...
Anyway! This was blast, very entertaining.. and I will miss knowing more about this characters forever. This serie made me question what is right and really understand the many layers of every human being walking this earth.",9,21 May 2019,6,48

6723,"Let me start with the storylines for each of the Starks; lovely and satisfying. Bran was quite useless this season but him ending up where he did made sense in the end. I love that Sansa stood up for the North and her crowning was beautiful. Arya going away to explore seemed like a bit of a reach but ok. Loved that Jon didn't end up on any throne, but back at Castle Black.
I am having some difficulty with this season as a whole because it was so rushed. Loved the first three episodes, but from episode four it has been one big mess of things not making any sense. Now don't get me wrong, I understand that series don't always 'have to make sense', but after all that buildup some things were just one big disappointment. Just to name a few; Aria turning down Gendry (now that would have been a twist! Lady Arya!), a dragon shot from the sky out of nowhere (all those ships were hiding behind a rock or what?), the whole meet where Missandei lost her head (so many spikes but no shot at Drogon?) and then there was Cersei's unsatisfying death.
Because of this I couldn't enjoy the first half hour of this episode, messy (Grey Worm somehow manages to kill all those soldiers and beat Jon to Danaerys?) messy (Arya lost her horse in which she road of with end of episode five?) messy...
Besides the mess, great to see Sam, Brienne, Thormund, Ser Davos and Ghost getting an ending they deserve.",7,20 May 2019,3,18

No, they're just fans who got steppes on their toes because it didn't end the way they wanted it to.The ending was different than I was expecting, but for me it makes sense for the multiple character arcs.

6730,"7 of the best seasons, in my opinion, but the last one, the worst!!! I gave it 9/10, because of the story: Daenerys dies-> end of wars, Sansa->Queen in the North (exactly what she always wanted), Arya-> starts a new journey ( ""what is west to westeros?""), Jon ""Aegon Targaryen"" Snow -> Nights Watch (exactly what he wanted), Bran ""3 eyed Raven"" Stark -> King (he never wanted it). The story is finished. Now, everybody can like it or not. In my opinion, everybody got what he/she wanted/deserved. Yes, Daenerys died, but just after she ""claimed"" the throne, and just after she became ""The Mad Queen"". I hoped other season 8, but this is it, with this ""Dissapointing"" finale.

6735,"These now famous words, uttered by Ramsay Snow as he mercilessly tortured Theon Greyjoy, seemed to carry the full weight of foreboding, not only where the rightful heir to the Iron Island was concerned, but the ultimate resolution of the series, as well. That fleeting moment was emblematic of the kind of series Game of Thrones was, and had always been.I became a devout follower of the series that sprang forth from the mind of George RR Martin when it debuted. I loved it immediately. The characters were memorable, the writing intelligent. In the penultimate episode of season one, when the noble Eddard Stark was beheaded for treason at the behest of King Joffrey, it became brutally clear that the normal rules of television did not apply here. I had not yet begun reading the books, so Lord Stark's killing was a veritable punch in the gut. And the hits kept coming. No one in Westeros was safe. The Fates could be kind one minute, and turn against you in the blink of an eye. Game of Thrones marched to its own drummer, not because doing so was shocking, but because Martin created a narrative that was fiercely unique. Life in the Seven Kingdoms was hard. The ruthless and cunning were rewarded; the soft and kindhearted were victimized. As Cersei Lannister opined, ""when you play the game of thrones, you win, or you die.There is no middle ground/"" And through it all, through moments of triumph and heartbreak, Game of Thrones remained compelling entertainment.But then something happened that ultimately fractured the series into two distinct parts. Martin's source material ran out. Notoriously slow as a writer, the series had exhausted all the books, and would sail into uncharted territory. And slowly, convention crept into the series. The kinds of cliches that were deemed acceptable in lesser series somehow found their way into the battle for the Iron Throne. The series was still highly entertaining, but it lost some of its edge. It lost some of what made it Game of Thones.Then the eighth season began. After a nearly two year layoff, with a reported $15 million per episode budget at their disposal, series showrunners David Benioff and D.B Weiss dropped the ball. The decision was made to limit the final season to six episodes. Though a few of them exceeded the usual hour long running time, six episodes was clearly not enough time to close out the show. One of the benchmarks of Game of Thrones the series was character development, and long plot arcs. We knew that the Battle of Winterfell was coming, when humanity faced obliteration at the hand of the Night King and the undead. For seven plus years, the specter of ""the great battle"" loomed. ""Winter is Coming"". When that was neatly wrapped up in one blurry and dark eighty minute episode, then the final battle would be against Cersei Lannister for King's Landing, and the Seven Kingdoms. That happened in another eighty minute episode. But during all these goings on, character development was completely thrown out the window. Story arcs were either ignored, or so poorly handled that it became maddening to see. And the characters we knew changed in profound ways. Daenerys Targaryen, who for seven seasons preached about how she would be a different leader, one that would ""break the wheel"", and leave the world a better place than she found it, suddenly morphed into the Mad Queen; she and Drogon razed King's Landing after the city's bells were rung, signaling the surrender of all enemy fighting forces. In the finale, she addresses a huge army of Unsullied and Dothraki (who, apparently, were not all wiped out by the undead). When Jon Snow kills her, the Unsullied, and Grey Worm, in particular, are understandably seething with rage, and they take Snow as a prisoner. Compromise is reached when the new King, Bran the Broken, orders him to return to the Nights of the Watch.But the Dothraki hoard? Where the heck are they?What kind of cookie do you give to an army of barbarians? We see Grey Worm preparing to take the Unsullied to the Island of Naath. But we're never shown the reaction of the Dothraki army. That's a pretty big oversight. This is typical of the shoddy script writing that plagued the final season. Instead of adhering to its own set of rules, Game of Thrones devolved. And we did, for all intents and purposes, have a happy ending. Sansa Stark became Queen of the now independent North. Bran is King of the six kingdoms. Arya is off to explore west beyond the maps of Westeros. And Jon Snow, reunited with Ghost, his dire wolf, and Tormund, leaves the remnants of Castle Black, apparently to head north to rule the Free Folk. It felt rushed. Contrived. All these loose ends were neatly tied off.This is not the series I have watched for eight years. This is not the series I have come to know and love. It was fiercely unapologetic. And the ending seemed to pander to the masses. Plenty of people are voicing their extreme displeasure on IMDb, right now, and they are right to do so. We went along for this epic ride, and at the very end, the rug was pulled out from beneath our feet.I am giving a 7/10 for the cast and crew who put their blood, sweat and tears into the last season. They are not at fault. Ultimately, they had to play the parts that were written for them, and the showrunners alone bear the brunt of my scorn. The fans, and the cast and crew deserved better.",7,20 May 2019,2,10

I wish that there another seasons!",10,21 May 2019,7,62
6741,"I really don't understand the hate this episode gets, and the hoards going out of their way to rate it a 1/10 is sad and, honestly, disrespectful of the amazing work these actors and crew have done over a decade. This show, like any, has its flaws, but every ounce of it is still better than many.Sure, everyone doesn't get a happy ending and the short episode list makes the season feel more rushed than the timeline really is. But this is not a world where everything is tied neatly away and fans get exactly the endings they want. With a show of this scale, there is no way that everyone, fans and characters alike, will be happy.One of Tyrion's lines near the end is that, ""No one is very happy, which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."" Considering each character and their individual arcs, they all end up more or less where they belong, or at the least where they world needs them to be.Dany showed violent instability from the beginning, particularly when things didn't go her way or when her authority was questioned. From watching her brother boil in melted gold to executing people who refused to kneel to her, she always came right up to the edge. However, she always had advisors to pull her back up until The Bells. As she lost more and more of her closest people (and dragons), she became more desperate and vengeful. If the gods flip a coin every time a Targaryen is born, Jon and Dany certainly show that.Bran is about as anticlimactic and well-suited as anyone could be to the historically brutal and selfish Throne. He ""doesn't want"" anything anymore and can literally see everything that has ever happened. He won't rule selfishly, he won't repeat history, and he is too mellow to hold petty grudges.Even Jon's ending was perfectly imperfect. While though killing Dany was certainly the right thing to do, he still assassinated a woman that thousands followed as their queen and that he had sworn to serve. Realistically, he should be exiled or executed. Yes, it sucks that so many people hate him at the end, but he was always happiest with the Night's Watch and beyond the Wall. It may seem like his true heritage was brought up for nothing, but it really illuminates how insecure Dany was in her claim to the throne and shows how desperate she was to keep power, while also demonstrating Jon's true nature as he did not want to pursue power.",8,31 May 2021,3,19
6742,"Look guys.. Enough of all the bull .. Yes it was a bit rushed script wise..( I would have stretched it out to a 10 part season).. like.. how did Jon get caught.. how did Jamie get caught... we could go on .. But at the end of the day this was a conclusive series.We would have moaned if it went on too long.. agreed? Honestly, I think the most important person in this, without us realising was Brendon Stark.. He started the war and ended it.. His story was so under radar but the most important. Let's be honest, we all questioned why his story was going on so long.;(my opinion) .. The night king wanted him dead more than anyone!! Why?? Now I think we know.. I think it's a great ending.. It opens up possibilities to future seasons.. What Arya will find.. Where has Drogon gone? Will Jon create something past the wall and finally will certain houses, want to be independent states.... It leaves a lot out there.. It's actually the start of democracy.. What their world wanted was a change and they got it.... They changed a system....Tyrion wanted that more than anyone, and he got it.He was the most pure and good in all this. He won.To conclude.. Yes.. We had wanted more substance to the story due to what we are used to.. but in a final season, did we really? This is an American story .. not and Irish one..",8,20 May 2019,3,19
6743,Yeah season 8 was rushed so much that the seasons we spent watching these characters development now seems kinda pointless... but the ending was good. What did u expect was going to happen?

Just a shame the whole of season 8 doesn't live up to the other 7 season so in that regard a massive disappointment but all in all a good ending,7,20 May 2019,3,19
6744,"While I am not a fan of season 8 (I am sharing the opinion that it was rushed, that the Night King should have played a bigger role, etc.) I still believe that this is the best we could get from the current setup. The last episode, even if I see everyone is rushing to give a one star rating, was not the worst from this season. Yes, some drama, yes, Bran was not one of my favorite for the throne, but think about it:
-they stopped the dynasty of Targaryens and the role of a successor to the throne
-the North remained independent
-Bron got his castle
-Tyrion lived
-Drogon left and I am sure Bran can control him
-the Unsullied left Westeros to throw spears at people that are ""giving up"" on another island (yes, I know it was Missadei's island)
the Dothraki, not sure what happened, probably just whistled and the horses left(was not really a fan of savages on a horse that are raping women and killing each other at a wedding for fun)-Daenerys burned people from the beginning, she always said she will burn Kings Landing, she delivered and she got what she deserved for episode 5 (while I like the way Emilia Clarke portrayed it, the character was not a leader, she was a tyrant considering herself ""God sent"")
-Bran will not have any heirs and they will have sort of ""parliament"" to pick the worthy/not worthy one, so a voting system instead of ""duh, I am the son of my father and I want the throne""
and Jon Snow, even if he was a Targaryen...that is what stooping a dynasty means...you should not rule because you are someone's son. Yes, he was worthy, but no he doesn't know how to be a strategist and how to be diplomat. He is too sincere. Hence, he was sent to the wall, to his friends, to the place where he felt like home and most important, to Ghost and Tormund. This is the life he deserves, free (he leaves at the end) and with his friends, without politics and such.So, yeah, does the season suck: yes, did our hero get what WE wanted? No. Did NED STARK get what he wanted? Remember, season 1? GOT is not your happy movie that will satisfy the needs of the viewer, it will satisfy the need of the character..it will shock you but it will bring closure to the characters
Did D&D ruin our experience? Part of it, yes. The entire experience, NO. So my rating is based on the time I spent with this story, the characters and the effort put in visual effects,actors, audio, everything...without the writers. Next time don't be in such a hurry, take the time to explore the world you are building for us, we cannot explore it by ourselves.",9,20 May 2019,3,19

I didn't care when dany died or Jon was send north. I nearly cried when hodor died and was in fury when rob stark died. D&D have proven how Import details, a story that makes sense and characters that act consistently are. Sadly in a negative way. Still I refuse to give this masterpiece of a fantasy world, it's actors and other staff members less than 7 stars because they deserved them.

Game of Thrones, set out to make you use your imagination, just like reading a book. Your unhappy, because it didn't end the way you had imagined it.
Yeah, majority thought the end would be the fight against the Nights King. Which it wasn't, you got that thrown in at episode 3, all dark, for the moaning ones.
Then you got a rushed battle for Kings Landing, showing how rubbish the Golden Company was. I wanted elephants.
Come again, the final episode was a happy ending, and they basically got to go off to where their life path was taking them. I was laughing with them.
When they are all sat in the hall. Tyrion turns up early and begins sorting the chairs. Davos, Sam (in his robes) and one half of Robson and Jerome (lord of lofty titles, now) and Bran getting wheeled in by Brienne. All is at peace, people are together, whom you wouldn't have expected.

6749,"I agree with most that season 8 seemed rushed and some of the writing a bit cheesy at times, but most, if not all, of the questions were answered throughout!!Jon Snow didn't want the iron throne and has said so for years, by making him king or otherwise would've started a war with the unsullied and dothraki, so the ONLY solution would be to send him north, and away from winterfell, where he ends up with Ghost and where Tormund always said 'where you belong'! so I don't see what fans are complaining about?! He was brought back from the dead to prevent the start of Westeros's national socialists effectively (might have been handy in 1938 perhaps?)I agree that the change in Dany was quick and perhaps overly played, but there was always the possibility of her turning mad like her dad and that has been foreseen, warned of and prophesized for seasons, whether fans like it or not. I'm not sure what fans expected? as measter targaryn said 'a lonely targaryn is a terrible thing' or words to that effect!!Cersei died with her brother's hands around her neck, again prophesized, and each and every method of dying and/or executed has been covered throughout 8 seasons so nothing would have been new to fans, how was she to die otherwise?! Jamie died as he wished to, so again I don't see the problem?Bran was the ONLY logical choice for king as his gift for seeing the past misdoings and evils of previous rulers will help him make future choices in similar situations for the good of the now 6 kingdoms, people saying Bran the broken is a disrespectful name have obs not read the books referring to bran the builder, from 5000 years previous in westeros lore. I agree with most that the council scene was cheesy, overly simple and included unknown characters, but I think the result was fitting for the conclusion to the series!! Sansa rules the north, Brans rules the 6 (and as 3 eyed raven can oversee them), Arya is doing what she wanted to from day 1 and Jon is alive, with Ghost and where he knew in his heart, he wanted to end up.

I'm not one to give a low rating because what happens is sad or because terrible and unexpected events transpire in the show. So although I would have liked to see Danny be a good queen or Jon end up as king I have no problem with Danny going mad or Jon getting screwed at the end. That's pretty much how life is anyway. I actually thought that the scene with Danny dying and Drogon's reaction was another brilliant effort by the producers. However, after Danny was killed everything fell apart. It was as if the writers said ""Ok we have to wrap this up in 15 minutes even though we really need a few more episodes! OK how about we have Tyrion declare that Bran will be king and from now on kings will be democratically elected? But Tyrion is a prisoner with no influence! Ok we'll have someone bring him in shackles to a spontaneous meeting of leaders where he will tell everyone how the seven kingdoms will be ruled? Sounds good let's get a beer.""
Wow...amazing how 15 minutes of lazy writing could ruin 8 seasons of brilliance. I truly loved every minute of game of thrones up to and including when Danny was killed. Then it was as if it suddenly switched to a 15 minute SNL parody.

Dany had to die but that scene in the hall give me serious Nazi Germany vibes, and was just great, She would have kept conquering if she wasn't stopped, Great Dragon scenes. Loved the idea of Bran becoming King which was so unexpected and the idea of choosing a King by vote among Lords of Westeros was a noble idea that really worked for me unlike full democracy which would have been ridiculous at that point. Sansa becoming Queen of the North was perfect and just shows her ultimate aim for Northern independence had nothing to do with Dany, She knew that the North suffered a lot and hence made sense for having a separate Kingdom just like before Targaryens. Arya going all Christopher Columbus so suited her character.Lastly, I am gonna miss GoT, this season felt a bit rushed 100% but still it was great TV for me, lots of great character moments, and I wanna thank D and D for creating such a great show, amazing actors and other folks who made it possible, It was just wonderful.",8,20 May 2019,2,11
6766,"I knew before the final season started-at least a year ago, I'd say-that I was going to be in the minority that enjoyed the ending of Game of Thrones. Don't ask me how; I just knew. So when the season started off strong, and showed promise, and then proceeded to spiral into a dumpster fire for episodes four and five, I was... less than impressed and completely at a loss. Was it going to end well? Were any characters going to get a semblance of a happy ending? Or were we just going to be left with a bitter aftertaste in our mouths, with no sweetness at all? Turns out, it was a combination of all three.The way you feel about the finale probably depends on who you've been rooting for, and who you can just about put up with, and whether or not you're able to suspend your disbelief for eighty or so minutes. If you can look past the mediocre writing and the 'we're just gonna wrap it up and slap a bow on it' end to a whole bunch of storylines, you're probably golden. And I could because I knew that I had to-this was final and we were going to have to make peace with it one way or another. In the end, I ended up enjoying it a whole lot more than even I'd first expected; A lot more than most people, and a lot more than it probably deserves given how rushed it felt and definitely was.But even though I liked it, this episode was far from perfect. The melting of the Throne was really just there for aesthetic purposes, and the scene before it fell flat because everything that happens afterward feels like it should have been part of another episode, another chapter. The first act is melancholy and somber, the second a soap opera riddled with treason and murder, but the third act is how the show sticks the landing, at least for me. It's what really makes me love the episode, even though it might be for all the wrong reasons. I've been on edge this whole season, there's no lying about that. My body was a literal bundle of nerves, wrapped up in my duvet and clutching my pillow, throughout most of every episode this year because, while I knew what was coming, I just couldn't imagine how it would all end.I've always been more of a lover of stories rather than their endings, so when Tyrion started his monologue before all the Lords, it's safe to say I lost my composure. He was right. We've spent years, textual decades for some, with these characters; we love them, we know them, and we understand that we have to say goodbye (at least here) to them. I was never on board with the idea of Bran ""part-time bird, part-time emo"" becoming King. It didn't feel right before, back when I had read the leaks and decided that maybe things weren't going to wrap up how I wanted them to or thought they might... but then it did. Something happened, and it made sense to me-in its own weirdly satisfying way. Somehow it felt true. Whether it was just optimism or the fact that I could never quite hate the showrunners, I don't know. But I thought of his story, and how he was the first Stark we were really introduced to way back when-in book canon, too-and then it just clicked.If you look hard enough, and maybe give the writers more credit than they deserve, you can make the case that it's all been there from the start. Tyrion as a hand, a Small Council made up of (mostly) wise people this time, and the broken boy becoming King of the Six Kingdoms while his sister rules the North-independent once again after eight seasons of hardship. It became clear that this group-these morally grey but, more often than not, good people-were going to be ruling, I finally felt like I could breathe. I sighed, in relief or heartbreak I'm not sure. I was glad to see them live, but also terribly sad that this would be the end of the road for them. No more growth, no more fighting, but also the end of the war and the end of tyranny. It was bittersweet to me; there may have been losses along the way, but hope won at the end. The lone wolf died, but the pack survived, and there's no reason to believe they aren't going to see each other again. This was a time for wolves. And a dream of spring is right around the corner, it seems.Maybe it's because I'd decided I was going to like the finale before the season even started, but I feel content enough with how things ended up. I just hadn't realised how much I'd like it as opposed to everyone else, and I guess now I'm going to be left standing up for a show-for a final episode-that did little to stick up for itself.",6,20 May 2019,2,11
6767,"I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I think the series and the episode deserve more than the 1 or 2 stars people are giving it. I gave it a 7 because even though I didn't agree with some of the plot points and I admit there are some plot holes (Why did nobody kill Jon after he killed Dany? Why didn't Yara want her own kingdom too after Sansa did?), but it is still worth more than that. The series as a whole has had a downturn in the last season, and I'm not defending D&D in any way for the plot holes they have been making. I also think that some of the storylines I agree with and made a lot of sense have been too rushed and therefore made less sense. But it is still the finale to the greatest show ever, the crew, the cast and everyone else involved deserve so much more than most of the people give them credits for. Also some of the characters got the ending they wanted, deserved and that made sense for them, even though we might not all agree with the way it was pulled off.That is why, even though I have not been happy with the story development in the last season, I still believe it wasn't as bad as people say, and that it deserves the 7 out of 10 score I'm giving it.",7,20 May 2019,2,11
6768,I have seen far far worse endings to shows. Let's face it with only six episodes it was going to be tough. Was the season the best no but no where near the worst I had ever seen. I liked how it ended.,9,20 May 2019,2,11
6769,"Broadly I, much to my surprise having read the leaks enjoyed this ending. Sure, I didn't want Dany to die...but in my my mind Drogon caries her to Asshai and a red priestess brings her back to life anyway.Was it perfect? Not at all. But generally I think the fate of most characters felt about right. However....I like many others have been very critical of the writing this season. I have a hunch that if this ending was the same, BUT episode 10 of a 10 part season where we discovered more about the White Walkers, their origins, what they really wanted, what Bran actually discovered, were they were not defeated so quickly, were Jon was involved in their demise, if things like Rhaegal being stupidly killed didn't happen, if Dany's turning into the mad Queen was more subtle...Then you'd find that people would be much more OK with how this played out. I think they lost many fans after The Long Night episode and the rage as just been building since then.It's a shame, as I agree with others that the rewatchable factor of the show has gone down a lot knowing how much they've butchered this season.",7,20 May 2019,2,11
6770,"As a base .. this final episode was not bad ( with some .. exceptions which since now, we are used with them ).But , because of the last 2 episodes and .. because of this season as a whole, many will find this episode not what it should be ( which, I agree to some degree ).Now, why did I gave it a 7 ? Because finally, we had some decent dialogs between the main characters, especially Tyrion & CO at the council table. Actually, I think this 7 is because of the last 25 min of this episode, because that was the most ..normal 25 mins from this season.Jon in the North? Makes sense. How they managed to get Jon here ( strictly based on the last episodes ) , does not.
Dany death? Makes sense. How they managed to get Dany here ( strictly based on the last episodes ) , does not.
Sansa , Queen of the North? Makes sense.
Arya, the ..Adventuress? .. Debatable.
Bran? King of the Six Kingdoms? ...i'm indifferent with this one :)Anyway, this could have been a good episode if the rest from this season would also have been ..decent.Was a nice ride GoT! I will surely miss you ( especially 1-6 seasons ) .May the old Gods and new Gods make the upcoming movies based on this awesome story of Westeros, at least on-pair with GoT.",7,20 May 2019,2,11
6771,I like out unexpectable this episode was but i didn't like the direction of the episode that was a bad directing Dave & Dan!,8,20 May 2019,2,11
6772,"An interesting way to end one of the greatest series ever made.Like the whole season, this episode was not free of rushed and scurried conclusions with lots of loose ends and plot holes big enough for Drogon to fall into. Still so many questions left unanswered, like where have some characters been this whole time? Or what happened to this or that? The episode had some cheesy writing, but it also had its moments, with some good throwbacks down memory lane and nods to George RR Martin.It was not the ending most people had in mind with all the hype and subtle clues from the earlier seasons. Maybe I'll do a Bran and re-watch the past seasons to make myself feel better. But nether the less it is the end...Long live the Game of Thrones.",5,20 May 2019,2,11
6773,"Reminds me of Matrix Revolutions ending and all M. Night Shyamalan movie endings, anticlimatic AF but at least M. Night's endings are a bit weird but this one was like a soap opera created by 3rd graders.If they would've ended with episode 5 it would've been 1000 times better.
I love this show still but the ending, don't have enough words to describe the disappointment.",5,20 May 2019,2,11
6774,"Maybe the ones who write these negative reviews are still in their cinematic infancy because the ending and season 8 was as good and as epic and brilliant as the past seven seasons. The GOT crew did an amazing job and I deeply thank them. I wish there was more ... This show is going to be at the top of any past, present and future ""best series, ever"" list!",10,28 April 2021,4,31
6775,"In a vacuum and at the end, I can see why so many are disappointed. But I look back at what was a sketchy Season 8 and find that if I re-watched the entire thing front to back, it will have a better cadence. The big events make some sense, even if executed in a non-sensical manner (I will not be able to get over the swiftness and unbelievable nature in which Arya offs the Night King, but whatever). There are gaping holes that can't be reconciled (no chance Greyworm or any of the Unsullied or Dothraki imprison Jon after learning he killed their queen - he's executed on the spot when he (presumably?) confessed to the killing). But at the end, to tie the story up, it will work. I wish we'd had 2 more books to close the story but it wasn't to be. It may never be. I think this crew did the best it could, and it could have been MUCH worse (and it could have been much better if we're honest). This final episode had some amazing footage and the resolution, while awkward and a bit sloppy, is not totally dissatisfying. I remain a fan. When my children come of an age appropriate for viewing this 73-episode epic, I will gladly enjoy every minute along with them. In the meantime, we still have hope of a more satisfying end by book, and the expectation that Westeros and Essos will live again in story. When Tyrion spoke of a compromise that left everyone unhappy, I felt that was the confession of the storytellers - Jon's voicing that it didn't really feel right or good. Without Martin finishing his books, I don't know that any ending could have felt good. There's more to come, and I look forward to that. Mesmerizing entertainment, whichever way you cut it. I give the episode a 7 but it could easily be a 6. But the series overall - still the best television I have ever witnessed, bar none.",7,21 May 2019,4,31
6776,"Yes, series 8 hadde too little time. Should have been two seasons, and there were plot holes but; this is an ending that fits the books and gives the kind of open ending that anyone familiar with George RR Martin writing will agree is inn synk with his visions.

As I followed the show over the last ten years, I need to say a huge thank YOU to the actors, the writers and all parties involved makinf this TV series so fantastic and incomparable. The characters grew up during the TV show and I am really fascinated about their progress. Giving this show just a 1 for the finale is disrespectful and is just about your overreacting emotional behaviour. Sure it hand to end at one point, bit in the end, the most complex, entertaining, ostentatious and just biggest series I could ever watch. Watchers, watch out again for a better end if you like. I accept it, the watch never ends. Mic dropped.",8,7 June 2019,5,43

6780,"I think except for some minor things the finale was well done. Even though the lotr reference (the soiaf-book) was probably meant as a joke it still felt cheesy (or unnecessary). The other (minor) thing of course is the short episode count and the thereby rushed storylines.
But that does not make the episode an unworthy finale. Especially arya's and jon's seemed satisfying to me (even though of course the night's watch isn't really needed any more - but who knows...)

Only what he's saving the world from is her self.They even tell you prophecies can't be trusted, but will come back to bite you.

6797,"Let me first say that I understand all the negative response to this last episode. I can't say that I'm not disappointed myself. But I'm not disappointed because of the way it ended. I'm disappointed about the way we got there. And in my opinion that is mostly because the last two seasons were just too short for the character development that everybody has grown to love about the show. And this mostly applies to Daenerys. She was sad one episode. Angry in the next. And absolutely out of her mind in the next. Something that should've taken a season or more, happened over the course of 3 episodes.Nobody ever sets out to make something bad. David and Dan probably did what they thought to be the right thing by making the seasons shorter (if this was even their decision). This let to everything feeling rushed. But even though I'm sad about the way it ended, I don't believe that George R. R. Martin had something completely different in mind.

It wasn't supposed to be what you thought, it wasn't supposed to be happy, it wasn't supposed to be predictable, that's why it's called storytelling. The story came full circle from season 1 to season 8 and the ending was unexpected, but what do you expect in a tragedy? The audience doesn't get to pick the ending of a story, the storyteller does. Not mad about this episode or the season.",9,20 May 2019,2,12

Dany's descent into madness was inevitable. It was sad to see as we all loved her character. The integrity of the story telling was there, along with the steady depiction of her path to madness made more inevitable by the deaths of those she loved.
I always believed that the Iron Throne would no longer be a seat of inherited power, and that Tyrion's purpose was always to facilitate this. I didn't pick Bran as the new ""King"", but I loved that development. Jon, Arya and Sansa were given happy endings and our favourite characters all found good conclusions. The writers were always going to polarise people. I think they did great job in finishing the telling of this story. I'm dying to see what is ""West of Westeros"".",8,22 May 2019,4,34

Back to the biblical part, I will not be listing all the biblical events and references, I will just mention Daenerys'.
Daenerys is more or less a female version of Jesus Christ in the show, she'd been the image of wisdom, power, justice, etc. moving from one city to another liberating the poor and the helpless all throughout the show. In the last 2 episodes she reaches king's landing (the city her ancestors built) and she destroys it just like Jesus destroys the temple (his father's house). Jon Snow kills her with a kiss just like Judas delivered Jesus with a kiss. Upon her death she gets carried by her dragon to the heavens who then is seen flying east probably to Volantis to find the highest red priestess to resurrect her just like Jesus resurrected.",8,26 May 2019,5,47

And what we got was complete opposite! It was actually a BIG ZERO of the finale that we got! They could have wrote a brilliant ending, even if they had 6 episodes. And all they could give us was couple if good moments here and there, but not a storyline coming to a grand epic finale! Whitewalkers storyline- No suspense! Bran- A junk dude did nothing! Jon- did nothing, Dany- Turned into a mad queen (im fine with it though but so rushed that doesnt connect)! There was literally nothing in the 8th season that we could relate with first 6 seasons! They made huge deals about so many storylines, which fell completely flat and made no sense! Why to make such big deals in the first place of Jon being a Targeryan n prince who was promised, when actually he ended up doing nothing and sent to wall. U ask, Was it even required to have him built up as a Targeryan and an heir to the throne?????
This season was a shocker, and ending was a complete dud! Bran the broken, a king! R u serious???????? We didnt watched these 7 seasons for this nonsense!
How about u had Night King defeats the living in winterfell. Jon captured by Cercei. Arya kills cercei with Jamie's face. Sam and Bran finds out about how to defeat the night king. Jon kills the night king. And Dany, seeing she losing the throne to Jon because of peoples love for him, n her loyalists dead in battle of winterfell, becomes mad and burns down kings landing (she didnt needed the army to burn down KL). Jon kills Dany out of duty in the end and becomes king as elected by noble houses coz of his bloodline!

They should of made at least 10 1 HR episodes again with a lot more attention to detail in these episodes as it would of only added another 2 hours screen time compared to the 8 wasted over 6 episodes it would of at least left the opportunity for more cliff hangers and also a not so dragged out ending trying to right all the wrongs with this entire series.

6805,"The episode starts with some minor mistakes... But as we go through the events, the number of plot holes goes from zero to countless, for reaching an ending where you feel the writers' budget was 10 dollars or maybe less!We are going to discuss below all the plot holes that seemed disturbing in the episode, so it's more a critism than it is a review.But first, let's discuss the good things first.
Yes, I think there were some good scenes despite the tremendous disappointment we all revieved in the end.
Let's start with the cinematography, it was fair and direct. Maybe nothing epic, but it wasn't bad afer all.
The music was insanely surprising. Credits go to Ramin the legend.That's it I think. Now let's have a real discussion.
Before we start, I hope I am wrong about most of these mistakes, because if not, then it was a waste of eight seasons...
Number 1: Jaime could have survived!The episode starts with Tyrion going through the ruins of his home, until he decided that he should go see what happened to his brother... Did he make it out of king's landing? obviously not. But there comes the first mistake where you can notice some parts of the ruins only fell on Jaime and Cersei while leaving other untouched ground. Does this lead us to believing that if they stood in a different spot they would have survived? Maybe two meters away! A dramatic minor mistake that doesn't make a difference but they had to die because whatever.
Number 2: Why is Jon still alive?Jon betrayed his queen on the battlefield by falling back, not to mention when he betrayed her for the first time by telling his sisters who he really is. Nonetheless, moments later he is standing up there celebrating the victory with her... Or planning on something maybe...
Number 3: Jon's sudden turn on his queen.It's known that Game of Thrones always choses to oppose the expectations surprising us, and that's what happened when Jon decided to stab Daenerys while they were kissing, opposing everything he just said to Tyrion in his cell about that ""she is my queen"" stuff.
It won't make sense either if he had it planned a while earlier, because as we know, it's against his nature to deceive someone into something to lure him for a bait.
Number 4: Drogon's extreme intelligence.He is an animal. Despite how smart he is, he should never be able to expect that the Throne is the reason behind all the wars that were happening in Westerous and that it has to be destroyed.
Or maybe he was thinking that it might have killed his mother, by stabbing her with one of it's swords, and that is just poor writing.
Number 5: Options 1 or 2? Definitely 3.Jon should have been burned alive by Drogon, but that was too expected and it's totally against Game of Thrones traditions isn't it?Else, they decided that he should be prisoned to face justice, neglecting the fact that he just saved everyone from the mad queen. Or did they forget what Jaime did to the mad king? And how he got away with it as if nothing happened. I believe it's quite the same situation.
So instead of Jon going free as an ending they decide to send him to the wall to avoid a war with an army that was just leaving... Also, did they miss the part where ""WINTERFELL"" is definitely an independent kingdom now? So Jon can go rule there without following the six kingdoms rules?
Number 5.5: How did they know?No one saw Jon killing Daenerys but Drogon. And he took her body as he flew away. So how was it announced that Jon killed his queen. Unless he was too dumb to say it himself.
He really knows nothing...
Number 6: The three eyed villian!He let innocent people get burned alive so there will be no option but him for a king! He obviously was preparing for that moment since the beginning of this season which clarifies that every rule he previously said about the Three Eyed Raven was completely wrong.The episode ends with a low budget council meeting with some limited actors and Brienne of Tarth finally getting Jaime's pages written, oh that was a good scene at last.The ending was not completely satisfying for an Eight years journey, also it was too good to be a Game of Thrones ending.
A complete disappointment.

Why is the north remaining independent?
Why is Arya going west?Just because.That's all this season has amounted to. Just a big list of nonsense.It actually hurts my insides to think of far Game of Thrones has fallen.Shame!

6814,"Wow. What a disappointment. Arya riding through the mist at the end of E5? Meant absolutely nothing. Jon - as honourable and brave as they come - lies to the face of the woman he loves in order to induce her to kiss him so he can stab her to death without warning. Then, Drogon just melts the iron throne for no reason and flies off to god knows where with Dany's body. Staggering anti-climax.The Council at the Dragonpit was, perhaps, the single worst scene in GOT history. ""All the great houses"" represented. Christ. Firstly, why is Grey Worm prepared to compromise in the slightest? His Queen, for whom he would gladly commit mass summary execution minutes before, has just been murdered and he is happy for Tyrion and Jon to walk off scot free while he sails east with every last Dothraki and Unsullied. Secondly, why is the system of government suddenly called into question by the Council? Before Robert's rebellion, things were largely peaceful with the Targaryens on the Iron Throne. When Sam Tarly - who seems to variously hold the offices of night's watchman, Lord Tarly and grandmeister throughout the episode - proposes full-blown modern democracy, I nearly turned the TV on. If there were more than half an episode of GOT left, I might well have done. In the end, Bran is ""elected"" by his fellow Lords as the new king. Why on earth would he be qualified? Especially since his own sister Sansa declares that the North is to be independent, meaning he is King in a foreign country. Insane script writing.The worst part of all is the decision to send Jon back to the Wall. WHY DOES GREY WORM COMPROMISE AND WHY DO THE LORDS AGREE TO PUNISH HIM AT ALL??? The former has lost everything he cares about; the latter would all have been burned and butchered as the enemies of the Mad Queen had Jon not saved them. He is exiled to guard the northern border of what is - literally - a foreign country. And against what, after the White Walkers were so lamely defeated in S3?? God only knows. Can't think of a single major character who's arc ends satisfactorily. Well done D&D. You've absolutely ruined GOT with this last series.",1,20 May 2019,1,4

And I wasn't disappointed at all. I understand the negative reviews though, the season was rushed, Dany's demise was poorly written (Drogon burning down the Iron Throne was pretty cool though), but overall: I like this ending! The remaining characters get a good closure, and I think (and hope) I detect a spin-off for Arya and Jon. And hopefully a continuation of the story of king Bran. I would like this season to be remade in a more detailed and more pleasing storyline. But if they don't remake it, I am perfectly content with what we have.

Maybe they could've taken suggestions or read through some fan theories from the internet. No. They chose to go on with this ridiculous plot which does'nt add up to its past character developments.
Where should I start ?
Okay here you go.Arya. I don't remember the season but all her training of becoming No One is literally thrown down the drain. Her only heroic moment was killing the NK but that didn't take any special skill from her training.Secondly. Bran becoming King. This is so stupid. Just two episode ago they mentioned of him being the 3 eyed Raven and someone who doesn't want to be a part of this world. And here he choose to be the King of the 6 kingdoms? Does the writer even know what the hell they are doing?Thirdly. Jon. And Night Watch. Really? Couldn't just Jon say that Dany flew away with Drogon ? Is Jon made to appear stupid or D&D are the stupid ones here? Drogon not killing him has to be most ridiculous scenes in the entire GOT era. They made it appear like the Dragon is smarter than Jon.I could go on with this list forever but this ending is seriously annoying and doesn't make the wait worth. All those NK hype. They threw it away. Final battle hype. They threw it away. D&D should owe us an apology for ruining such a great show. They should've taken their time or maybe step down from the role.

6847,"Literally nothing in this episode makes sense. The scenes felt like they were spliced together the last minute. The characters arcs over the years were obliterated and pointless. Their decisions illogical.
So basically Jon aka Aegon aka the biggest secret in GOT was nothing more than a plot armor for Jon not to be burned to death by Drogon after he stabs Dany because he's a Targaryen so Drogon melts the iron throne instead and flies off with Dany's body and that's that. A few weeks later the lords of Westeros come to the gathering and we learn that Jon is now a prisoner so they decide to elect a new king and they choose Bran because he knows all the stories (wow how amazing), so everyone agrees. Forget the fact that Bran is a Three-Eyed Raven and the last one lived for thousands of years, no explanation on that so he's pretty much a king for life now (but who cares about the details). Sansa gets her independence for the north from the newly elected northern king (again amazing stuff people) and Tyrion is Hand again. Grey Worm wants punishment for Jon and if he goes free it will be war between the Unsullied and the North so in the end Jon is banished to the wall, five minutes later the Unsullied leave Westeros for good mmm what?? Bran can just pardon Jon the next day after all he killed a tyrant and probably saved millions of people from suffering. Nope. Jon the true heir to the throne arrives on the wall where he finally pets Ghost and rides even further north with Tormund and the wildlings.

It's bad when you look to the person next to you and say, ""When will this end?"" Because it's just so unsatisfying and boring. The Dany storyline was ridiculous. It's obvious they did a 180 on her character for shock value. The writers were trying to force a narrative on the audience without earning it. I have so many issues with the ending, I'm not even going to get into it. It was just very anti-climatic and felt like a parody episode. I can't believe they ruined the best show on TV like this.

This is the biggest insult to every woman who has had, and still has to go through that).
And please note that my review, and rating, is based COMPLETELY on the obscene and disgusting writing, it has nothing to do with the cast, the crew, the special effects crew, make up, costume designer, stunts etc, those where amazing.

Does it feel right when the same show is being rushed up to an epic disappointed climax ? No.
Game of thrones was probably the only show where you would be left wanting more after every episode. It was all about journey. It was all about the throne.
The Dany - Jon scene was so rushed up that the death scene could not even properly be executed. It felt like a compulsion on behalf of it's makers.
Game of thrones is known for it's execution of death scenes. This season has been the complete opposite of it.
Yes. The episode was far better than the previous 2 content wise but it still didn't feel like the Greatest show on Earth !
Since, we don't know what's west of westeros and where drogon is, it is best that the Game of Thrones has ended because we, ardent followers of the show, couldn't feel more disappointed after what D&D has done to the greatest show of all time !",5,20 May 2019,1,4

Tonight my doubts became a reality, but guess what? No surprise 7th episode. I'm an idiot, but at least I didn't get ""mother of dragons"" tattooed across my chest. This last episode really did feel rushed. A couple more episodes probably would have rectified that, at least for me, but no such luck.

How regular people can never win in a capitalist OR theocratic OR authoritarian system, and people still believe in them.The ending was a good closure and mirror of the real world, a good story.The age range of lower ratings clearly show that, they need to experience the world more and should be able to see, not every ending supposed to be what you want it to be.",10,7 July 2021,3,23

6890,"The episode itself is comparable to the last moments of the return of the king. Its just a resolution to the series tying up all loose ends as best as possible. Standing on its own the episode is good, but most rate it based off the the episodes leading up to it.",8,21 May 2019,2,13
6891,"The cinematography, acting, scenery, directing etc was all fantastic. The story was great, the only real issue is with the series feeling a bit rushed. But it does so much right, shame people are forgetting that part.",9,20 May 2019,2,13
6892,"To be fair, I haven't read the books so maybe I'm not a ""proper fan"" but I honestly don't think it's that bad. I mean, I don't think there was ever going to be an ending everyone was content with. Personally, I'm a bit disappointed because I was actually rooting for Dany to sit on the iron throne and for her and Jon to stay together. I don't really get why the writers felt they needed to remove her from the equation but who am I to say. Even so, I still think it's a worthy ending to a great show. Sure, the last season didn't have the same magic as the rest but I'm still a fan of the show and I still love it. So, if you're going through these reviews, and all you see are bad reviews, I'm here to say it's not that bad. Not perfect but definitely not bad.",7,20 May 2019,2,13
6893,"Let's be honest here.
I have loved this series as a whole especially the incredible episodes 3 & 5. With no base material to work with, the finale had one job - to tie up the series well. Like it or not, that's what it did. Dany was the last objective. We all wanted to see Jon as king but we don't always get what we want! The episode was beautifully done. A more subtle conclusion than expected but none the less it left me with a feeling of completion.",8,20 May 2019,2,13

Dany died, the dragon torched the throne and flew off with her body, Jon Snow was exiled to the North, the Starks will govern themselves, thank you, and Bran becomes the King-ish sorta' person, with Tyrion being his back up..... as Michael Corleone said in The Godfather, ""It's the smart move""...For those who say ""Dany did a 180 degree turn in one show..."" Nope.... she's been showing little hints of that almost from the first season.... from the death of her brother, to the death of King's Landing, she's pretty much gone along with ""Death"" as a way to resolve problems... as her death proved.

As most of us I think the story could've been told better, perhaps across two seasons, but equally, I think the creators of the show did an awesome job in terms of cinematography, costumes, music.
There's only one question that troubles me, the way I now know how things end, having this bitter taste in my mouth because I have to accept that with all their qualities, despite the wide character arcs that they've had, not Dany nor Jon are fit to rule, will I ever want to watch the show again?",5,20 May 2019,2,15

It is a compromise, no one gets what they asked for (except fot Sansa maybe). That was always what GOT was about. It is not a Disney ending that fans crave for, neither a total slaughter of all characters. It has some form of closure and was beautifully filmed. I feel satisfied. Haters will hate, for me this was solid enough.",8,20 May 2019,1,5
6923,"Here's some shows with bad endings: The Prisoner (1960's version) ended with what looked like a riot at a mental institution. Bad, because no explanations or closure for anything. The Sopranos also ended with a well-produced but controversial ending which provided no closure or answers to any questions.In contrast to these examples, GOT ended with closure for most of the storylines and answers to most of the questions. It's not a bad ending simply because you don't like where the story went. And are you even sure you're blaming the correct writers? Even though the show went past the books, The most important plot points still were shared from GRR Martin to the HBO writers..",9,20 May 2019,1,5

The entire 8 season run sunk as the bizmark in a bottomless pit of despair. Danerys the queen on the Iron Throne what a vision completely wasted. All other characters act completely contrary to the way they have been doing, John himself ordered execution of a young boy for treason but turns on Dani and the all powerful queen is all alone. To top it off Greyworm doesnt take Jhons head, i mean really. Truly Pathetic, the rest was just too pathetic. As if the director just rushed through it.

After watching it I feel like they have no clue what happened before S8 even though they wrote some of them too. I'm so disappointed. I feel sorry for everyone who has been waiting for it so long, like me, and feel nothing good about it. How could they destroy so many character developments plots, the logical sense of this amazing show? I've got so many emotions from 7 seasons and the only thing we all asked was to have the great finale. It didn't matter was there a happy end or not. Just logical, interesting finale.

They had all the resources to create the best Season 8 but they chose not to because they already got their money and want to move onto Star Wars. It really is a shame.

S7 and S8 were rushed with most of the story continuing outside the show. Clever characters like Tyrion lost their wit and others like Jon didn't get a good ending. Overall, they butchered the show, destroyed the characters and now they are going to be making so much money off the reruns and the spin off shows.I know that a remake is never going to happen due to the vast amount of money already spent on the show but I at least expect a public apology from D&D for their extremely poor script and their arrogance in thinking they could continue without the books.",1,20 May 2019,1,5

It took seven seasons to develop the story and make several fascinating story lines but when it came to discloser they messed it up.
I wish it would have ended up better because the game of thrones wad so precious to me and I had lots of memory and good moments with it a and I really got disappointed and sad.

What about marriage of Tyrion and Sansa? There is no word of it, even though they were officially married... the writers didnt even mention it... I get the point why Bran would be a good choice... but the guy's story was stopped being developed a while back...I felt like if they were to break a wheel, make the rule of the kingdoms be a council or something...Unsullied you want the reach? If no, we will give it to Bron... Just plain sad... I can certainly see how Bron could gently strangle the cripple and then take the throne for himself now that he has the cash and power...They should have had more marriage scenes...House Tyrell perished too easy with their ancient history of serving high-garden... and giving it to a cutthroat is just retarded...Overall the writers did tie loose ends, but the knots were too weak.A deserving 6/10 for the effort and cramming potential 3 hours of video into 1",6,20 May 2019,1,5

The Sopranos, The Leftovers, True Blood, Six Feet Under, and more recently Veep and now Game of Thrones, all had final episodes and/or final seasons that left fans underwhelmed and wanting more. Not sure why this is, actually. Probably just that the shows went on too long, and the writers ran out of good material.

D&D rushed things, and as a result what was once a monumental achievement in the TV landscape, never once prone to lazy storylines, became a very predictable, truncated story. What happened with the first three quarters of the episode? Like in the previous episodes, characters' decisions deviated too far from their traits. The script was weak no doubt, exemplified in the part in which Jon says an original quote, and Tyrion replies by looking confused. So it all comes down to this: watching this episode, feels like a glooming sunset to what was once a glimmering sun.
The positive: Superb acting as usual, the ending left me in tears. The best possible conclusion to the Stark family.",8,20 May 2019,2,16

It was impossible to finally deliver an ending that made sense after all. That's D&Ds fault and they have to live with it their entire life!But to rate this episode 1 star is disrespectful to all actors, to the special effect department, to costume designs, to the whole crew!

Tyrion carrys this episode like he has in so many before it which makes is all the more enjoyable. Following him walk through Kings Landing and watching him find Jaime & Cersei was heartbreaking and so well done.The Starks emerge victorious after all the hardship they have been through in all 8 seasons. Apart from Jon who is shipped off back to the Nights Watch, which i accepted because If he had won the throne it would of be painful obvious.Jons ending is just a reminder that not everything is alway going to be ok... Just because your the hero of the series that doesnt mean you get every major story plot point based around you and i respect how his arc was finished.All in all, i enjoyed the ending and thought it finished the series on high, maybe not a action packed high, but a heartbreaking, emotional, and meaningful high which saw all the character arc come to a close.And now my watch has ended.",9,21 May 2019,3,31

This season was top notch, it provided me lots of feeling: feel of anxiety in episode 3, feel of surprise and wtf-is-going-on in episode 5 and feeling of sadness as lots of characters part with each other. The scene when Jon was saying farewells with his family touched me most, especially when he was embracing Arya. I love Jon's ending and he is never supposed to be a Targaryen. His place it in the North, where he went. It is very sad that he maybe never see his family again, but I am looking for a possible spin-off of Jon's or Arya's arc. Looking forward Arya comes back one day and visits Jon beyond the wall. Despite of Jon's bittersweet ending, he has nowhere to go but with wildlings beyond the wall. He is their leader and no doubt he will establish a great kingdom one day.

6977,"I think giving this episode a 1/10 like most people are right now is a bit childish. I'll even say we deserved a much better and epic overall ending to the series but the show isn't ruined for life. Tarnished for sure by season 8 but certainly not ruined. My ratings for each episode have been a 7, 6, 5, 6, 8 and 8 respectively. I liked the overall ending but I hated the first 4 episodes overall. Bad writing lead up to episodes 5 and 6 but those episodes themselves were quite solid. I'm guessing that was the ending George R. R. Martin gave to Dumb and Dumber to help get them out of a hole in my opinion. But everyone seems to think it was horrible.",8,21 May 2019,2,18
6978,It is a bitter sweet ending. Jon killing Dany completed the prophecy. One problem I had was the fact that Jon was the true heir but once Dany was dead they never acknowledged that fact.

As early back as seasons 1 and 2 there's been subtle hints, nods, visions and so on for what is to come all along Dany was always going to become her father she became far to power hungry. Jon never wanted to be charge again this has been said multiple times by Kit Harrington's character throughout the series he doesn't want the weight of the world on his shoulders. GRRM said multiple times in interviews it's ""NOT GOING TO END THE WAY YOU THINK IT IS""!!!!! Hello people stop obsessing over every little detail just because you don't like how the show has ended just because you wanted sunshine and roses and angels and nice lovely things to happen to the characters of Jon and Dany, once again I say ITS NOT DISNEY!!!!

6983,"I come to imdb and all I see is hate for this episode/season.I have been watching since it first came out, I have fallen in love with the characters and wanted to see their ambitions play out, and that's what this episode did. Did it feel rushed? Yeah, a bit, that's the only reason I gave it 8/10 stars, this season should have been longer. But, at the same time I can understand the writers and producers not wanting to drag it out.I think the choices made in this episode portray the characters well and shows that everything comes full circle in one way or another. And that's what I think everyone is upset about, that despite it all, the realm of Westeros will continue as it did, but with some changes for the better.Would I have rather seen Daenerys continue her path of death and destruction without any of the others stopping her? No, that would have made no sense given their dispositions.Would I have rather seen Daenerys spare Kings landing? No, because that doesn't fit her character, and that's it, look back and you see a string of controversial choices made by her to kill all who stood in her way, or opposed her ideals.Even the Unsullied and Dothraki deciding not to execute Jon for the murder of their queen was in character because, as Sansa pointed out, had they executed him they would have been surrounded by enemies that have fought with them and know their tactics now and their best weapon flew away.Overall I think this was an amazing end to an epic.",8,25 May 2019,1,6

6987,"And why do I say that?
Well.. This last season is not great. It's ok. It's filled with shortcuts and character development not thought through. I give my rating in that regard.
Should the season have been longer, to better wrap the stories? Yes.
Should the Night King and his whitewalkers have a better ending? Most definitely And resounding yes!
Did the characters get the fate they were truly meant to have? Yes I really think so. Their fates really suits the characters development (though badly rushed this season) through the seasons. Too bad the rest of the season was rushed the way it was.

The problem with this episode, and the season, is the sloppy writing and story choices. Bran, who really hasn't done anything amazing or good story wise, became the King? How about Sansa, or Jon, or Tyrion or Arya, who have all suffered and had some great story arcs, one of them undoubtedly should have gotten the throne. Daenerys storyline this season was not that good of a choice, since they did go the Mad Queen route, they should have explained it in further detail than they did this episode. In all honesty, it wasn't a terrible episode, it had its moments, but it definitely wasn't a great episode.",6,20 May 2019,1,6

VERY DISAPPOINTED!",6,20 May 2019,1,6

It was probably the one part of this episode that wasn't predictable, which was nice. I already had my expectations lowered drastically by season 7 - the Beyond the Wall episode and Spoils of War were really bad fan service and made me lose all hope for GoT... so that's probably why this last season didnt disappoint me as much as some other viewers. S8 wasnt great, but at least it was slightly better than s7.",6,20 May 2019,1,6

It's not about makes us suprised we should've been amazed there is a big difference between these two. You guys have just killed a years of a great man work. In some point I believe those new writers forgot that jon snow is targerian. What's about bran can't roll the north because he is the three ayes wagon and now he is the king of six kingdoms. They could've let deny roll at least that's will be better ending than this poor thing they've comeup with. There's a contradiction in many parts of the original story . But in the end it's what is . Thanks for all your efforts thanks for all the joy that's we received.",5,20 May 2019,1,6
7003,"The writers of this show grasped the one thing that many fans seem to have missed--there is no ending if the petty violence and retribution continue. Given the history of our heroes and their families, I'm sure this was no easy task. Who would you have win?
Team Cersei (admittedly, I belong to this group): If Cersei is on the throne and basically anyone else is still living, there will not be peace.
Team Daenerys: If Daenerys is still living and basically anyone else refuses to bend the knee (um, Sansa), there will not be peace.
Team Jon: If Jon goes on to rule and he is there a) because he kills Daenerys or b) because he pulls the ""rightful heir"" card, there will not be peace.
Team Jon and Daenerys: If Jon cannot convince Sansa to bend the knee (and let's face it, though season 8 might sell him a bit short, he's never actually been all that eloquent), there will not be peace.
Team Tyrion: If Daenerys is not dead, this will be treason, and there will not be peace. If Daenerys is dead, Tyrion's treasonous actions would still enrage Daenerys' minions and there will not be peace.
Team anyone whose actions were in some way glorious or ambitious: You've pissed off and/or threaten too many people, so there will not be peace.
And none of this even acknowledges the one obvious truth that the throne itself had been the problem all along. Even the dragon understood this simple piece of wisdom. A show called Game of Thrones was never going to be about who becomes the final winner of the throne. The games can only end if there is no throne.
The Daenerys problem. For those of you who cannot stomach the ""drastic changes"" in the Queen's behavior, consider this. It was the Allies who dropped the A-bombs in WWII. It was the Allies who completely destroyed Dresden. Daenerys didn't suddenly turn ""bad."" She wanted to win, and she wanted to win RIGHT NOW. That's why she immediately traveled south though her troops were well exhausted. And she believed her actions were justified because she HAD to win for the good of humanity. As Tyrion tried to explain, a ""good leader"" with an excess of confidence in his/her righteousness is as capable of terrible deeds as any enemy.
So maybe the Night King was built up too much, but isn't that just part of the point. The living thought the greatest threat to their existence was the dead, but it turned out they were their own worst enemies. Think of the ash falling from the sky, creating the same effect as the dreaded ""winter."" Think of the ever vengeful Hound and Sir Gregor flinging themselves into a fiery abyss. For those who did not care for the dialogue, read the images. They alone spoke volumes and made this season worthy of far more than one star.",9,3 June 2019,2,19

Personally, I watched the series because it was fun, new, many times shocking and exhilirating, but I never had favourites. From the very begining I understood this was a story of many peoples and nations, a story of intrigue and politics in which any and all characters were expendable. I watched the last episode with the same eyes: expecting nothing and rooting for no one. The episode did not answer all the questions I had in my head, but the ending itself was not disappointing.

7013,I loved game of thrones. I still do. I believe many are rating to punish D and D because the episode wasn't a ten. Was I entertained ? Yes. Would I watch it again? Yes. Did the ending make sense pretty much. I don't like Bran the Broken especially since there are not weir woods in the south and that's where Bran draws his power from. I didn't like the questions that I still have like where the heck was the valenquar? Why have Arya learn to where faced if she wasn't going to use that? Why is Jon still making out with his aunt? George said we would learn all we needed to know and ragear and Lyanna But where was the whole plot point that Lyanna was not kidnapped yet let a whole war start? Why didn't Arthur Dayne just say hey Ned can you help us defend your nephew King Aegon? Anyway I was still entertained,8,24 May 2019,3,39
7014,"Yes it was a reasonable ending, kings are not the greatest warriors whom people adore,kings many tines are just the more educated or the wiser(like Alfred the great in the last kingdom)so I can understand this especially since we talk about epic fantasy and a medieval era.Also I can understand the Targaryen madness so yes Daenerys'madness would be expected IF THEY HAD BUILT the story better and not in such a hurry.Thats why Martin is the author and not the directors and probably that's why it takes so much time for a good book to be written.When we talk about littérature and not just another popular book it always needs time.Thats why season 8 SHOULD NOT BE the last,HBO should wait Martin to finish his work and season 8 should have just built the rest of the story
If this had happened maybe it would be different to see a crazy Daenerys or not John Snow as a king etc

7019,No one was ever going to be happy with whatever ending was given. It was never going to be happy ever after unicorns and fairies... Everyone got an ending it was ok and I was content at that. Drogon survived and John finely scratched ghosts head so even for that it deserves a 7.,7,20 May 2019,1,7
7020,"First the likes:
Well Drogon obviously. Burning down the iron throne somehow knowing, feeling that it wasn't Jon who killed his mother but her urge for power. I found it a very satisfying scene, seeing the throne melt down.
In general the scenes up to Dani's death were pretty good. I liked the forshadowing in Maester Aemon's conversation with Jon back in season 1(?).The second half of the episode. I didn't like that much.
First: how do they know Jon killed Dani? Did he hand himself in and just admit it? No one else was there, so he could just flee. There was no dead body to be found, so they wouldn't question him immediately. He had all the time to go outside the walls of Kingslanding. Also if Grey Worm and his army went back to Essos how would they check if Jon remained at the Nights Watch? It's not like he would go there every now and then. And I don't expect him to have any Whispers there.The scene in the dragon pit was a bit lame as well with Edmure and Sam. Instead of some deep and good politics what the series is (or was) famous for, they just fill it with awkwardness and a suggestion that was laughed away (I hope this is an English expression as well ;)).Chosing Bran as a king. Mwah...? I guess? A bit weak. Knowledge doesn't make you a good king. Although it is symbolicaly nice, cause there is no Iron Throne anymore, but because Bran always sits in his wheelchair he doesn't really care for that. (If he emotially cares for anything at this moment).Not the best episode. Not the best season. Not the best ending to one of the best. Altough I think the last two episodes were way better then the start of the season with the Long Night and stuff.I hope we get a spin-off with Arya (still played by Maisie) exploring the west to make up for it.",6,20 May 2019,1,7

Do you think George Martin is going to take it to a different place? This is what they had to work with.I hated last weeks episode it left nowhere else to go, so instead of putting off the inevitable, they dealt with it and wrote a one hour epilogue.It could have been a lot worse, it could have been like last weeks episode where that mad queen spent the better part of an hour burning her subjects into oblivion and that would have made one more bad episode and zero time for an epilogue.",7,20 May 2019,1,7
7023,"I don't have a problem with how anybody ended their story. This episode is basically a setup for spinoffs and sequels. The Adventures Of Arya. Grey Worm's Revenge. Whatever else.

7024,"Last week they spent the better part of an hour showing us that Daenerys Targaryen turned evil. Fans had to endure that episode so they could have Jon Snow sympathetically murder her in the next episode. She had to die.The good news is this happened very early in the episode which gave the writers enough time to wrap up the episode in a semi-satisfying way.It could have been a lot worse, they could have spent the entire episode building up the suspense and not developed the conclusion, or they could have done it the way they did. They get a seven for not blowing it. But a masterpiece ending was nowhere to be found.",7,20 May 2019,1,7
7025,Overall I think that it was a pretty good ending to a great show. I like the direction all the characters took like Arya going off to explore and Jon going to live beyond the wall but I don't know how I feel about Bran being king. Personally I think it's a little out of place but I understand why he is king. Loved the endings for side characters like Bronn and Podric I'm so glad he became a knight. I think this season has been really underrated as it's mainly getting criticism from people who either don't understand the story or don't care about the story.,8,20 May 2019,2,22

7030,"Don't want to get into how unsatisfying this finale felt.... But it didn't totally disappoint either.
For about 20 mins it felt like the old GOT. The part where Danny starts her speech. I thought maybe it was trying to teach us a lesson all along.
The lesson being NOT to root for revolutionaries and ideologues. They burn the world, stand on the ashes and still talk about freeing people. They may be beautiful people, talking about beautiful ideas, but when it is their turn to rule, they'll be worse than the worst of them. Sorry! Enough ranting :)",4,22 May 2019,1,8
7031,"I agree with the majority that season 8 (and to a lesser degree season 7) of Game of Thrones has been below the standards set by the first 6 seasons, The final episode follows that unfortunate path and delivers a dumbed down, simplified version of the show that feels rushed and - worse - forced.The episode looks stunning and the first 20 or so minutes works really well in my opnion. If we accept the premise from episode 5 that Dany has become the ""Mad Queen"" then we can enjoy the start of episode 6 that follows Tyrion and Jon on their way through the city while taking in the massive devastation. The episode functions well up to and including the best scene of the episode where Jon confronts Dany. After that the plot unfortunately drops off a cliff. The summit scene is just ridiculous and the election of Bran as the new king is the most forced plot line in the entire show. It is just not believable and that is very disappointing coming from this show.
The ending is basically one large cliché where everyone goes ""where-they-are-supposed-to-go"" which is the most un-GoT like ending I could imagine.I will rate this episode a 6/10 because of the first half that is very good, the acting that is still strong (except the summit scene where the writing is simpy too lame), and because it just looks amazing. The score is generous cause it is hard to forgive Season 8 and a very mediocre ending to what is arguably the best show ever produced.",1,20 May 2019,1,8

The show pictures the realistic of the leaders in this world, Instead we expect the director to continue the glory of the series till end.
The Jon show character should have been judgemental(Like he stood with wildlings), but he is in't and writers make sure he is not suit for throne. that's the only good part.

Was it as good as the Breaking Bad, Mr. Robot, or The Shields finale, No but it was still a good way to end this great show. The only disappointment that I felt is that this show was over because it is one of the greatest shows ever!!! GOT thank you for 8 wonderful seasons!!!!",9,17 July 2021,2,26
7041,Was it the ending I wanted for this show? Nah.. but I'm not sure how I woulda wanted it to end either. This whole season before this episode was awesome!! Short but awesome. This episode was sort of a let down in a way.,6,22 May 2019,2,26
7042,I thought it was actually quite good.its been built up just like lord of rings.the fighting had to stop at some point.,8,20 May 2019,2,26
7043,"Yeah it's cliché, mayhap it was not up to the standard of the first 3 seasons, none of the other's were, but the ending filled me with joy for it's was just a happy one.
The writers were not afraid to create one of the darkest shows on TV and however dark it was they were not afraid to change course.
It takes bravery to end such a show like this.
I recently watched ""Oldboy"" by ""Chan-wook Park"" first of his name, what a horrific story it has to tell, what gruesome ways are used to show it - Chan-wook is also not fearful but in those other areas, he will shock, manipulate and sadden the viewers all to prove points, to show who's king.
A different kind of bravery Chan-wook shows, on the other side of the spectrum, and the way I see it ""Game of thrones"" could've ended in two different ways, the ""Chun-wook park"" way or the ""Weiss-Benioff"" way.
I prefer the latter, sadness, fear are a huge factors in any type of media, sometimes the best movies are the most depressing, leave them where they belong and out of shows with 73 episodes.",6,29 May 2019,3,50
7044,"Giving it an 8 just out of respect for the entire series and the music/CGI. Also as underwhelming as this episode and the whole season was, it's not a 4.2/10.Definitely the worst episode and the worst season, but I still believe it (neck and neck with Breaking Bad) is the greatest show in TV history. It just unfortunately had a sloppy and rushed end due to the 2 idiot writers D & D. And I still rank it so highly based off the brilliance that was seasons 1-7.",8,13 June 2019,2,27

7046,"This season was one of the most action packed seasons of the entire series. They put about 3 seasons worth of material into 1 season. If HBO would have kept the show for more seasons, people would be happier with the ending, even though it would be the exact same ending. That's all people are really mad about.People have been falsely saying that George R. R. Martin had nothing to do with anything past season 6, but it's not true. He quit helping on the show to continue the remaining novels in the series, but he has been giving the show writers chapters of his books and notes on how the series will end.",8,20 May 2019,2,27

7049,"It would be hard to write an ending to do justice to the overall story. Sure, there were disappointments... who wouldn't have wanted a better end for a couple of those that died (no spoiler, but I'm sure those who saw the last episodes can guess who we mean).There's a period on the end of this story, no real cliffhanger to elude to another season. However, there is obviously room to continue the story if desired as well.Thank you for eight wonderful seasons - I look forward to ""The Movie"" set 10 years in the future (I'm just guessing here, but that's my guess).",7,20 May 2019,1,9
7050,"I liked the ending events as events. I did not like the execution of it, but the events themselves are quite good and they are consistent with the very beginning of the story.I think GRRM told D&D the ending he intended and they screwed up the path to that ending, but the ending itself is quite good.Bran as the king is fitting, it's the only real change that Westeros has seen in its politics. Jon becoming a King is a return to square one with no moral behind the story. Bran becoming king especially that he cannot have kids is great, for once the throne will not be inherited. It will be about who actually deserves it.The scene where Jon killed Dany was poorly written and executed, it still is what I wanted to see, just not the way I expected to see it from what was the best TV show ever.Sansa winning the North its freedom was also great, because that's all she ever wanted. She didn't even want to be the queen (evident by her last conversation with Jon). But she would happily take it given no other choice. This goes well with her arc, she isn't like Cersei, she never was. All she really cares about is the North and its people and she kept true to that.Arya going west is also fitting, she's done with whatever she came back to do.Tyrion becoming the hand of the king to seek his redemption through his expertise is also fitting. He made mistakes, but he always followed what he believed to be righteous.The king's counsel is a great one, those are the people who carried the world from destruction when facing the Night King. Who else is better to rebuild it?Jon's fate is the best one I could think of. He went back to where he always belonged. The North, or as Tormund puts it, THE REAL NORTH. HE FINALLY GOT TO PET GHOST AGAIN.
______________________________________________________So again, while I do like the events, I'm taking three stars for the poor execution. If I read those events in a book, it would be a lot better simply because my imagination will serve them more justice than this episode has. I think this is a failure on D&D's side where the TV show must always reflect a very good representation of the events.While I hated this season, I think this episode brought something back. This is why I think it's GRRM's ending and not D&D's.",7,20 May 2019,1,9

7052,Anyone who thought John and Danny would take the thrown and live happily every after weren't paying attention for 8 seasons. If you thought GoT was going to have a Hollywood ending you were deluded. Season 8 is a bit rushed and not as well executed as previous ones.

7054,"While there are flaws with the final season in general (to do with pacing, with edits and character motivations feeling occasionally forced as a result of the rush), there is something to be said for the neat way that everything was wrapped up.With such a diverse cast of characters, it was always going to be difficult to wrap up every loose end in a satisfying way - but the way that things have ended up is satisfying in that it feels like a natural progression for each character based on their actions in previous series and the foreshadowing littered throughout.",9,20 May 2019,1,10

It is a cheesy line, from one character who lost his purpose, to another who lost his purpose as well.The last episode wasn't totally bad, but that is only thanks to the amazing acting skills of a set of decent actors, who had this script to deal with while accepting what was left for them. But the damage is already done. The game is lost, the song is faded, the legend of the white walkers forgotten.

Overall I was extremely disappointed with season 8. Especially how fast the ""real enemy"" (night king) got defeated and a few other things.This episode however was better in my opinion, I expected it to be way worse.
It was a good ending for the show im my opinion at least as follow up to the last few episodes.",7,20 May 2019,1,10
7058,"Alright so these last 2 seasons have been pretty disappointing overall and I would have changed ALOT of things if I could regarding the Night King and Cersei. Alot more characters could've been killed of too and this ending would've still worked fine so I'm quite surprised they didn't during the battle for Winterfell.With this said. I think the ending was pretty good relative to where the story has been taken even if I'm not a massive fan of WHERE the story has been taken.The Daenerys death was quite underwhelming so that sucked. I expected it to be a WAY WAY bigger deal than it was but yeah, that's DnD at the moment. They just try to ""get things over with"" these last 2 seasons. Characters arcs? Meh... I don't know.I'm still 50/50 whether I like Bran becoming king or not, in a way I like it. It's the goal a lot of our beloved characters have strived towards the entire series, a just ruler but there are so many other characters that would've satisfied me more than him.All other aspects of the episode where pretty good though. Sansa being Queen of the North, Tyrion becoming hand again (Better if he was king but whatever), Jon back to the Wall (Better if he was king but whatever) and also Arya heading off towards the unknown, doing what she loves.In conclusion:
A decent ending to an absolute sh'tshow :D",7,20 May 2019,1,10

7074,"I felt compelled to write a review to counter all the negativity surrounding this episode and the season as a whole. Now that is not to say I am oblivious to some of the major flaws of the season. It's hard to deny the sense that the story has been fast-forwarded and really rushed for most of the last two seasons. It's also obvious that the writing hasn't been nearly as tight as the first few seasons, when they followed the books and reality more closely. This is a trend that has been going on since season 5 (and even parts of 4), so it hardly comes out of nowhere.I think a big part of your enjoyment of this last season depends on your willingness to accept this fact. It's undoubtedly a shame that the show has moved into more standard tv territory, but I'm also of the opinion that the characters are still as compelling as ever, and what the show lacks in tight writing, it makes up for in production and visual design. These last two episodes in particular have been absolutely breathtaking from a visual point of view. Episode 8.5 is an absolute masterpiece in pacing and set-up, followed by the gorgeous and brutal destruction of King's Landing. It's honestly one of my favorite episodes of the entire series, certainly one of the best made episodes in television history (again, from a production point of view).Which brings me to the next point on which your enjoyment depends: your willingness to accept the fact that Daenerys may not be the good guy of the story after all. People seem to think that Daenerys transformation into the Mad Queen seems very sudden and uncharacteristic of the character. This is a point of criticism that I find much harder to swallow, because I strongly feel that Daenerys' turn into madness has been massively hinted at since season 1. Unlike many people who seem to be a fan of Daenerys, I have never bought into Dany's savior complex and have been skeptical of her intentions from the start, or at least certainly from season 3 onwards. She's always had an unhealthy obsession with conquering the throne, and an overblown sense of entitlement all throughout. Tyrion's conversation with Jon is almost a conversation of Tyrion with the fans, trying to remind us of how much we all rejoiced when she was burning and crucifying people alive, simply because we taught of them as the bad guys. The madness was clearly always there, and definitely more front and center in season 7 and 8. Yet when she finally snaps and gives into her worst instincts towards people less deserving (after losing almost everyone she cared about, including Jorah, Missandei, and another one of her dragons, and feeling betrayed by her closest friends/advisors) it's somehow uncharacteristic? Sure, maybe the moment in episode 8.5 itself was a little sudden, and the idea needed a little more time to breathe, but the storyline itself is an entirely valid one, even despite the hastiness of the story. It's a beautifully nihilistic storyline, that we can't always truly overcome the worst parts of our selves. I even view it as a mental illness issue, that our destructive side nests inside us and can come out of every one of us if we had the power to do so, which Dany has.As a continuation of this Mad Queen storyline, I thought the finale was completely satisfying. For the first time in years, Tyrion was actually his clever and useful self again and key into shaping the ending. Tyrion seeing the dead bodies of his siblings was heartwrenching. Jon and Dany's visually stunning throne room scene was emotionally satisfying, not in small part due to Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke's amazing acting. And I loved the way they actually wrapped up the show. It may not be the most realistic and believable ending, but it paid great hommage to all these characters we came to love over the seasons. My favorite was Brienne finishing Jaime's entry into the Lord Commanders' White Book, but I'm also pleased with the Stark children's send off. They have always been the emotional core of the show, and I think they have suffered enough throughout the story to be given a positive ending, even if that may not be the most realistic one.Overall, despite its rushed story, I was very satisfied with the final season. A show like this was always gonna end on a divisive note, with so many fan theories never coming to fruition. I do think the show would have benefit from a few more episodes, or maybe just a small restructuring of the last two seasons. After having given it some thought, I would have like to have seen season 7 in its entirety being about the battle against the White Walkers, while season 8 would have been about the final game of thrones. I think that would have given the story a bit more focus, and feel less rushed.
But I'm also willing to accept that the makers decided to go a different route, and gave us the story we were given. It's damn hard making a good tv-show, and I appreciate all the love and effort from everyone involved that has gone into making this. And hey, there are always the books for those who are so angered by the show. If they ever get made that is...",9,20 May 2019,1,12
7075,"While the finale was not without its flaws, it was hardly worth a 4.5/10. It was a difficult task for the writers to tie up the last 8 years of storytelling and I think it was executed with grace. The events of previous episodes may not have worked with the rest of the show but they have worked in tandem with this finale and I believe D&D gave it a touching and deserved ending.",8,20 May 2019,1,12
7076,"The last episode was good to end this awesome series with. In the first part of the episode we get to see how the main character react to the destruction that Danny has made. Danny's arc is fulfilled in this episode, as she goes full mad queen in her speech. It stroked me hard and emotional to see one of my favorite characters become that, what she had sworn to better as. Emilia Clark performance is outstanding, she convinced me as viewer that what she had done, was right in her eyes. This is were Jon comes in. His struggle to follow Danny from last episode continued further in this episode. At first he tried to understand Danny, even as he had serious doubts about her actions. It's only when he talks whit Tyrion that he makes his decision. There has been a lot of critics about the dialog of this season, but in my opinion had these scenes whit Jon and Tyrion one of the best we have had. Than did the big moment followed: Danny's dead. When I watched the scene i was stunned when Jon seemed to give in for his love, I was shouting to the screen not understanding why he kissed her, as it was clearly the wrong decision. But than came the twist, blood started to role out of her nose. It was at this point that I knew what had happened. Besides that I wanted this to happen, it still made my cry. Jon did what he had to do, even if he had to kill his loved one. In my opinion it was the right move to kill off Danny there at that moment by Jon. The setting was perfect, next to the iron throne, next to that what she always wanted. She gets killed by her loved one, to avoid that she goes full mad queen. It couldn't be better in my opinion. It's not just killing off a character, it's a kill that Jon has to make but doesn't want to make. This makes the moment super emotional as he says that she will always be his queen. This line struck me as it is a speech where Jon lets Danny know that he still loves her, but didn't wanted her see become the evil mad queen.After the emotional dead, we go further in time to a meeting. All house leaders discus who would become king. It's here that I have a problem. In my opinion Bran shouldn't be named king. All series long he refused to have power, and now he wanted it out of nowhere. The other character endings where more fitting. Sansa becomes queen in The North, what is fitting for her. All show long has she done things in function to help the north. Next is Arya, who sails away to explore the unknown. This is a perfect end for her character, as she goes there where 'no one' has ever came. And finally we have Jon, he got send back to the nightwatch to avoid his death sentence from the Unsullied. At first I had mixed feelings whit this decision, as I had hoped that the council would choose him to be king of the 6 kingdoms. But after thinking for a couple of hours I think it is decision that is better for his character. Jon also didn't wanted to become king in The North, and he was one of the best of the nightwatch. This makes it for me more acceptable to she Jon return to the place where he became the Jon we all know and love.I know the show's 8th season gets a lot of critics, but in my opinion was this the end that was inevitable except maybe a couple changes. Therefor it is for me a logical way to end this amazing show.",8,20 May 2019,1,12
7077,After episode 4 and 5 i was getting a little dissapointed and worried about how they would end this spectacular series. Was it the best ending no. But when the credits rolled i did not find myself dissapointed. I was content. I think everyone leaving a one star review is being unfair. There was never going to be a happy ending. But the ending we were given at least held up to the rest of the series.,7,20 May 2019,1,12
7078,"Here we go again: just because you guys didn't like the episode, doesn't mean it's a 1/10. The worst game of thrones episode is still better than most episodes of any other show.The ending was what I expected, but way too rushed. Every problem I had with it could've been solved by adding three-four more episodes to the season. Suggestion:After Daenerys' speech (which could've opened up the episode), Sansa turns up outside of kings landing with her army. She has sent ravens all over the seven kingdoms, telling everyone Jon is the true king. Sansa demand that Daenerys puts down arms.Daenerys refuses. We understand that she's about to attack. In the last second, Jon stabs her. The unsullied attacks, but are defeated. Jon (for all I care) could've died. He fulfilled his purpose by murdering the mad queen.To me, this would've made a lot more sense. Also, it wouldn't have to be a long battle. 5 minutes for daenerys speech, 15 minutes until she's killed and her troops defeated. Then 1 hour for the aftermath.Instead, they wasted a lot of time on the dialogue between Tyrion and Jon, where Jon turned out to be the most stupid man alive. Thats the weakest part of the episode to me. That, and daenerys being killed so easily and not even surrounded by guards. Like wtf, could we not at least have seen Jon being wrestled down by Greyworm afterwards?Anyway, as this is my last review of GoT ever: Thank you D&D for the greatest show ever run. I hope you understand that the bad review comes from people having really high expectations, now from the show (or the ending) being a bad one.Thank you for the best 80 hours of my life.",6,20 May 2019,1,12

Few little mistakes here and there and that's why I'm not giving it a ten. Tywin said wisdom made the best ruler. There is none wiser.

you think it sucks? well, try and make a career in show business and start to write your own show. and then, we can see how many of these people shouting ""it sucks"" and giving low points can do something worthwhile.
it wasn't a perfect ending. but it was an ending. I see people around saying ""the whole 8 season was a waste of time because of the final season"" well, as stannis baratheon once said: A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good.",7,20 May 2019,1,22

7103,"Let's start with the positives, the ending scene was beautiful, most of the characters fates were satisfying and the musical score was great. However this episode has many flaws. Firstly, Danys death could have been so much better, perhaps if Jon had killed her moments before she executed Tyrion this scene would have been so more better. Another scene which annoys me is the election scene, why Bran? A better choice would have been someone with experience or even Gendry who had Targaryen blood, a compromise which would have pleased the unsullied and the lords and commoners of Westeros. Finally, a small change which would have made this episode much better was if Jon had a more justifiable fate, the unsullied must have known there was no need for a nights watch so why was he sent. A better fate would have been either Jon dying or just going into exile.",7,14 August 2019,0,9

7107,UTTERLY DISGUSTING!!! I once loved the series. Turned into complete drivel at the end. The writers butchered everything in a few episodes and this is completely disappointing.

7109,"My expectations were already low, but oh my god...No, I don't care about any fan theories or whatsoever. I don't even care about what is the ending.
What I care about, how they delivered it. They tore down the lore, they messed up the pace. And the logic flaws...
Anyone who says this is at least 8/10 or something, is that kind of person who would be happy with any crap so long it's called ""Game of Thrones"".
I mean, this season got 6 episodes right? Let me present it to you how I see:Ep1-2: People coming together, basically serving fans with reunions. You might start to think there would be at least one really important person who will die at the Battle of Winterfell.
Ep3: Darkness. No, I didn't watch on a tablet or a TV from '80s. You can see the zombie dragon -who tore down The frickin Wall- destroying one wall. Almost. But you can definetely see the decay of the show when Arya learns how to teleport.
Ep4: I don't really remember anything besides the death of one dragon. I cared this much.
Ep5: Best episode of the season. You might realize that the Mountain should have been the biggest threat instead of the Night King. Apparently, you know more about the Mountain than the Night King. And what you know about him? Yeah...
Ep6: After 20-30 mins everything is solved. Logic flaws everywhere tho, but who cares, it's Game of Thrones, isn't it? Yeah. Have fun watching the last hour, where won't happen anything new, just the discussed things.",1,22 May 2019,0,1
7110,"This is the first review I've ever written for IMDB. And i felt the need to write it to lower the score as low as possible. I started watching game of thrones when season three had just come out and I stayed on top of it since then. This ending was just abysmal. I commend every other facet of the show, the exceptional visuals, the superb acting (despite what they were given), but the writing was horrendously rushed. Sure, I would have liked a better ending, and I can understand some of the closing events ending the way they did but they weren't explained at all! Everything felt so rushed. Whole character arcs were forgotten or completely butchered (Jaime). The massive scope that the show provided in the beginning was gone. The witty and beautiful dialogue, gone. There were just too many inconsistencies. How could bran be king if he literally said 2 episodes before hand that he ""did not want"" and was no longer Brandon Stark. Dany's death was too quick and just pitiful (Emilia did a great job, but the writing for it was terrible). Dany's army had exponentially regenerated since previous events. Jon turned into an idiot who could only spout ""she's my queen"" or ""I don't want it"" at specific intervals. Tyrion's clever nature was completely gone. The white walkers which was supposed to be the MAIN antagonist, circumventing all of the political strife, and it was gone in one episode. The list just goes on and on..It's just so disappointing to see such a terrible ending to a show that started out so fantastic. Oh well.",1,22 May 2019,0,1
7111,"This is my first review ever on IMDb. I usually just like to browse and see what some movies/shows get rated to see if I should watch or not. But after this season I felt the need to give my opinion about how terrible this season of GoT was. D & D were offered 10 episodes by HBO for season 8, and they definitely should have taken it. If they would have had 4 extra episodes, maybe the story they wanted to tell would have been better, not been rushed, not missing key elements, and actually made sense. I don't mind, Dany going mad, John killing her, or even Bran being king in the end, BUT and that's a huge ""but"" I have a problem with how we got to those points. An extra episode or two would have been nice and needed to see how Dany dove off the deep end and went mad, and needed a couple more things happen to her to push her off the cliff. And I hate when people say the signs were always there cause she executed people, cause the two characters with the best values Ned Stark and Jon snow have executed people. And the whole 3 eyed raven thing makes no sense, we never really have any idea the full powers that Bran has, I mean he says he's not Bran anymore, but yet he can be king in the end!!? Like if he sees everything and can warg into people or animals ( like direwolfs, Hodor) why wouldn't he warg into Drogon and stop the destruction of king landing, or tell Dany about Eurons ambush. And don't even get me started of euron, what a complete waste and terrible character, like why was he even in so many scenes. The whole Jaimie and Cersei ending was stupid and didn't make any sense with their characters arcs/development, basically everything Jamie has done throughout the show since he got his hand cut off was thrown down the drain and I was disappointed. Not to mention all the prophecies from the books and earlier seasons mean nothing, like the valanquar, Aryas brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes from Mel ( who was her green eyes then?), and not to mention the Prince/Princess who was Promised. I thought this was one of the most important elements of the show, but it actually meant nothing all along. This episode was terrible and made no sense to wrap the show up. If Dany was mad enough to kill an entire city based off of an impulse ( that's what D & D) said in the after show, why wouldn't she kill Tyrion right away or soon after he disrespected her to her face. Instead she keeps him prisoner and lets him meet with Jon who she claimed to have committed treason the previous episode, so let's just let them talk and conspire. If she was mad and paranoid this would never happen. Plus when he met Tyrion he had to give up his weapons, but when he met with Dany the queen he was able to keep his weapons, plus she has no guards around her. Like come on that's so illogical. The drogon seen was corny, like if he was upset his mom died, why wouldn't he burn Jon or the entire castle, instead just flies away around the world, that's so laughable. And why would grey worm, who is ruthless and already upset with Missandei's death, keep Jon as a prisoner and not just kill him right away for killing his queen. Then the whole council scene following was ridiculous, Tyrion would have been executed along with Jon, for conspiring to kill their queen. And even if they weren't, like Unsullied had the strategic advantages, so why would they be scared to fight the remaining northmen. If it weren't for Dany, the unsulllied, Dothraki, they would not have been able to defeat the night king, and beat Cersei and the Lannister army. So they just let them do all the dirty work and give them no respect in the end, especially Sansa. To me this season just felt so rushed, full of plot holes, and they just wanted to hit on these major plot points without fully telling the story. Highly upset, disappointed. I just wish the night king would have killed everyone. To be honest that would have been a better ending. Hope in 10/20 years someone with a brain will redo the last 2 seasons and give the fans/actors/characters the ending we all deserve!!!!!!",1,22 May 2019,0,1
7112,"Welcome to Game of Thrones Season 8 where time-space, laws of physics, behavior of persons can be manipulated at any time into any direction by any amount if the plot demands it ...Events in the past which you thought were important, are not revelant in the present, or even forgotten like they never existed.Characters were dumbed down to bare minimums, or completely butchered by show writers.Tyrion who was the smartest man in Westeros, he was able to get out any situations now looks like a dumb clown. Whenever he gives an advice to Dany, she loses something, or if Dany wants to do something on shes own he tells him she cant.
Cersei who dealt with all her enemies with cruelty since season 1, now just stares out of a window or a castle wall and drinking wine.
Bran who become one of the most mysterious beings in Westeros, just stares someone from his wheelchair all season.
Varys the spy master who had information about everything (he had so much info they thought he has magical powers) is a furniture now since season 7.The list goes on, but the two main characters got the worst.Jon who was one of the most honorable man, who always helped his friends, always did the right thing doesnt matter what burden he had to carry now sneak kills Daenerys while kissing her. Puts a knife into her heart and tells her she will be hes queen forever... Disgusting. Also he got dumbed down to two sentence in this season: ""You are my queen"", ""I dont want it"".
Daenerys, the innocent young girl who always protected those who couldnt protect themselfs now turned into the main antigonist of the show. She was the savior of Westeros for like 70 episodes but in the last 2 episodes they completely changed her character. She died betrayed.... and the last episode which makes no sense:Cersei died in her loving brothers arms to some bricks. Tyrion cried when he found them. Feels like the show wants to tell me Cersei was a victim. Cersei who did crimes since season 1 even his son commited suicide because of her actions ...
Bran who told he cannot be a lord of anything, when Tyrion nominates him as king says: ""Why do you think im here?"". Even though he did nothing whole season, he become king in south, where arent any weirwoods trees and noone follows the old gods.
Torgo Nudho wants Jon to be killed, but when Bran sends Jon to the Nights Watch, he accepts it as a fair ""punishment"", even though the Nights Watch doesnt exist anymore (even Samwell Tarly the sworn brother in Nights Watch is not there now). Also how can Bran send Jon to the wall when the wall is in the North and the North now is independent form the 7 kingdoms?
Yeah Sansa did nothing in Season 8 (other than annoying Dany) becomes queen of the north asking for independency even though her brother is the king in the 7 kingdoms. Everyone agrees, and noone else wants to be independent.
Bronn who was a Lannister cutthroat all seasons, doesnt even participated in the fight vs the dead, now become lord of Highgarden, and becomes the coin master.
Brienne who's a knight for like 2 months becomes the lord commander of the kings guard.
Samwell Tarly the never finished anything in the citadel is now Grand Master.
Arya the 150cm 40kg terminator sails to west of westeros, because noone went there yet, not even the Greyjoys even though their land is located at the western shore of Westeros and they always lived in the sea.I know season 8 makes no sense, you know it makes no sense, even the actors know this makes no sense.What happened is D&D got Star Wars, and they wanted to finish this as soon as possible and these are the results:1/10.",1,22 May 2019,0,1

7114,"I used to be a huge fan. Not bluffing. I read the books. I loved the show. I extremely loved season 6. Season 7 was quite slow and I waited 2 years for Season 8. I don't even know where to begin with but the show has lost its logic since episode 1 in this season. It started off very slow and showed too much unnecessary scenes and left the war with white walkers for only 1 episode?? For real?We all already know that Dany will be killed at the end and it is not surprising that Jon would be the one doing the deed. However, D&D have built Dany character for 7 seasons only to kill her for being ""mad"" that is explained by killing the whole city with no logical reason behind it? Jon loved her so much and killing the love of his life right after Tyrion stupid influence is literally the stupidest thing ever in the show. I used to really love Tyrion as a character and for what he'd been through, but season 7-8 just made him look dumb and dumber. He literally said he loved her but told Jon to kill her? He knew damn well the throne would cost lives the day he met Dany.And the dumbest and perhaps smartest(?) part of the episode is also when drogon consciously melted the iron throne but let Jon live after killing his mother??? for real though?One more thing, Bran had this amazing story, journey and etc. only to end up as King? with no contribution in killing the Night King/ Cercei?? Are u kidding me, D&D?? Sure he knows a lot. No one can even explain why Night King wanted him dead. Ok he has humans' memory. But not lives right?? He did not even use his ability at all yet he got chosen by Tyrion as King?? Maybe I was wrong. Tyrion's most stupid decision is when he chose Bran for having a good story. Dude, even a complete new character would be better at this point.This show has sucked too bad. I only read reviews before. Now I really want to join in to bring this down. D&D chose Star Wars over GOT and no fan will respect them ever again for this crap.I actually found an interesting alternate story ending written by a fan.

Any unexpected twist in the story would've made sense had this not been the final episode. But 'alas' this was the winding up episode.Points I didn't like in the final episode:-1. Everyone secretly & indirectly advised Jon to get rid off Daenerys for the good future of the kingdoms. When Jon did that everyone is happy and they all got what they wanted or loved.....Sansa getting a free north under her control....Tyrion getting elected as the hand......etc.2. Bran Stark always said he don't want to rule the North. But when it came to ruling the 7 kingdoms the cripple readily agreed to become the king and announced that he traveled from north for that. I find that development ridiculous especially because he's one among the few who knows Jon's true identity as the rightful heir to the iron throne.3. Jon's true identity as Aegon Targaryen was a BIG NEWS.....but who benefitted from that....Sansa & Bran Stark. Had that fact been kept a secret by Bran or by Sansa, Danny wouldn't have felt insecure about her claim to the throne and Jon would've loved her as before. And his love probably would've stopped her from killing all the innocents at kings landing.4. Missandei was captured by Cersei. But what was she doing in a warship. She was only an adviser to Daenerys, not a fighter or an army leader. So her presence in the ship heading towards kings landing was really a stupid affair.5. At the king selection meeting no one talked about Jon's true identity as the rightful heir to the iron throne, even ""Arya"" or Jon's closest friend ""Samwell Tarly"" didn't. Everyone looked afraid of Grey Worm and subordinate to him.......It seemed Grey Worm was the deciding entity and no one wanted to offend Grey Worm.6. 90% of king selection committee comprised of Stark family and their relations. They all looked very happy and no one actually seemed to care about Jon's predicament. They were ready to sacrifice Jon for their personal gains.7. What's the need of Night's Watch because truce has been established between the wild-lings and the men at the night's watch.8. Jon was seen moving out with the wild-lings into the forest. Where was he going?
An alternate ending if I were the Writer:-Tyrion having seen the lifeless body of his brother and the destruction of the entire city and the killing of innocent lives realizes the mistake he has done in believing in Daenerys.He realizes that Daenerys is no different from the Mad King.He walks towards Danny while she was addressing her army and kills her:- either by slicing her throat with the ""pointed Symbol for HAND"" or stabbing her with a knife.What happens to Tyrion: He either gets killed by Grey Worm who was standing near Daenerys or is send to Night's Watch.Danny dies on Jon's lap.

This was such a failure on so many levels, this wasn't just D&D, this was the result of many mistakes made by HBO as well. How many people knew it sucked and still let it through. Way too many loose ends not tied up, over simplistic resolutions, and poor story telling in the final episode of the best tv show of all time, until the last episode.

There is a Stark in most places of Westeros and they're all in roles they were meant for.Yes I'm disappointed Jon didn't get the throne as was his birth right, but he never really wanted it. Yes Dany going down the mad Targaeyron route wasn't my favourite choice either, but it was always a possibility that I knew could happen. I loved Drogon's reaction to her death too, I thought that was a nice touch - along with Ghost finally getting some well-deserved and long overdue attention!The main and very serious question still on my mind is something I think we should all consider... how is Ser Davos is still alive after everything!? For a man who ""isn't a fighter"" he's done bloody well to survive! Now that's a question worth answering... I'm thinking there must have been a few barrels for him to hide in!!!But on a serious note, thank you Game of Thrones for one of the best TV series to ever grace our screens. From the actors, set designers, special effects team, costume makers, writers and directors, you have given us a masterpiece. Thank you.",7,20 May 2019,0,8
7153,"Yes season 8 was too rushed, yes not all the stories ended the way ""you"" wanted them and yes some plots ended weakly...BUT the story had a fairly satisfying ending, for one house anyway, and more to the point it looked great as usual and the music was excellent as always.

The story ended, but left enough room to keep the story going.There were less weird situation then other episodes and everybody important got an end. The world has changed, there was also some humour again. And with the change, some things never change and that was funny to see for me.I still have many questions and I expect far more answers (why does a dragon understands the thing about the throne?), but I think I must start reading the books to understand everything. For now this is a good end, completely in line with the story and it is only 1 end.I do not think so much about it, I was entertained this episode. It gave me a good feeling.

It also made sense him killing Dany, as she wouldn't have stopped killing until everyone bowed down to her as the one true ruler. If Sansa and the North asked for their freedom she would have burned them too. He saved the realm by killing his love.Bran becoming King made sense too, as he had no agenda. Every other ruler has had their own agenda but he won't. Tyrion knew this when he suggested Bran. Bran will use his Three Eyed Raven knowledge to do what is best for the 6 kingdoms, he will serve the people.I agree this season did feel rushed and it really lacked in the dialogue between characters.

Jon's story about being a Targaryen went to nothing???? He did what Tyrion told him to do, now Tyrion is the Hand and what is Jon? Away from her family and the titles he deserved.

7191,"I know you are genuinely disappointed. Honestly I was super excited for this season; and honestly I liked everything till episode 5. I liked how realistically dark the war for Winterfell was, how Aria ended the night king. I liked how loss of a best friend, loss of love, loss of a ""child"", life of a vagabond & Cerci's tyranny drove Danny insane enough to burn them all.
Honestly I was okay till the part Jon kills Danny and Drogon breathes fire but not at Jon. The iron throne should not have been burnt. Drogon should have just flown away with Danny's body.
I choose to remember that moment Game of Thrones ended for me.
Alternatively, then this could have happened:
Jon gets arrested willingly by the Unsullied. Few days later - an army led by Sir Brienne under the command of Sansa; with the support of Arya, Sam, Davos, Bronn, Tormund, Gendry & Yara surround the city for the release of Jon & Tyrion. The unsullied and the Dothraki assemble. The armies get ready to face off. Sansa walks her horse to the empty space between the two armies from in between the crowd as they make room. Greyworm walk ahead from the other side to the same space. Drogon lands behind Sansa's army in support - controlled by Bran ""from"" Winterfell. Sansa gives a great speech 'Cerci did what she had to. Daenerys did what she had to. Jon did what he had to. War has killed and destroyed people, kingdoms, families and love - it is time we build a new Westeros where blood will not be shed & where the night will not be long. Step aside or everything your queen fought for her entire life will be for nothing.' Greyworm tears up then steps aside, so does his army.
Next scene: in the destroyed throne room full of people. The leaders are stood on the stage as Jon walks across the aisle towards them from prison. Jon comes on stage next to the iron throne, when Tyrion talks to all 'this city was my home and home to thousands of innocents. Daenerys had a good vision, a good heart, but pain blinded her' then gives out Jon's true identity and ends by saying 'he is the true king and rightful ruler of the seven kingdoms' Jon says 'All my life, I always wanted to do what's right. I don't know what I have done is right or wrong. I never wanted to be king, nor do I want to. I might have the right by blood, but I am not the right king, the right ruler. But Sansa you are. You have always done what's right. And the seven kingdoms will do right by you. You are going to unite the seven kingdoms. You are the right queen'. Important people on stage doesn't talk, just nods. People start chanting 'Queen of the Seven kingdoms' Sansa hugs Jon and accepts. She stands in frame with the iron throne, people continue chanting, theme music plays, camera zoom out, out, out into the sky and the kingdom looks like the intro map of Westeros.

John killing his queen for the good of the people (remaining people) was a good addition to the plot but the way it was presented just wasn't right.Why did everyone ignore John's claim to the throne? Surely killing a Tyrant queen responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocents would make John a worthy leader - even if John didn't want the throne..Why was selecting a new king even an option? It seemed like some sort of comical get together of old chums casually deciding the biggest decision of the show. Poor Sam got laughed out when he suggested an alternative to tradition. So why did they accept a king that cant provide an heir with a caveat of some sort of electoral system after Brans rule ends? (Also what was the deal with the guy bashing his sword against the post?

Every single one.Jon Snow, the main hero, brought back from the dead to kill Dany. Jon Snow was made a Targaryen to destroy Dany. They reduced his character to a plot device for Dany's downfall. Yikes! The showdown between him and the Night's King never happened. That wouldn't have been shocking enough, right? And in the end he is forced to go back to the Night's Watch. Ridiculous.Daenerys turning into the Mad Queen in two episodes is a complete joke. This can't be defended. Foreshadowing != Character Development. The 180 twist was neither shocking nor was it logical. You can't go from A to B if the bridge and the build up is missing. Normally if a character does something bad in the show, I dislike them (Ramsay for example) but this time I was mad at the authors. Completely unbelievable storytelling and I found myself rooting for Dany to just burn down everything, including the whole show.I don't even want to talk about Jaime Lannister.Now to this episode. It was beautifully shot. It looked amazing. The soundtrack was amazing. The acting was amazing.The writing was horrendous.The scene between Dany and Jon. Drogon burning the throne and ignoring Jon. Stupid!More idiotic things:
Tyrion as a prisoner basically choosing the new king. Grey worm and the Dothraki just accepting that they killed their queen. BRAN BECOMING THE KING.

On the other hand, I feel a little sad and disapointed with the desicion of Jon Snow, he was the rightfull heir, but the lords desided that the kings/queens should be chosen instead of following the heir(and for good reason, because the hole show have showed us what heir can do). But Jon Snow deserved some reward I think, but he didn't want it, he WANTED to go north with the wildling, so everyone got what they wanted really.

I have never felt this unsatisfied by an episode of any TV show let alone a Game of Thrones episode.The way they just glossed over Danny's turn to madness and then her death was just the tip of the iceberg. The fact that just a couple scenes before, Greyworm was slaughtering prisoners and then he just captures Jon and doesn't kill him instantly did not make sense for this new Greyworm they were trying to portray. It felt like everyone suddenly had new roles that are contradictory to their whole arc up until this episode. Suddenly Bran now knows that he was going to be crowned the ""king"" or whatever they want to call it now and that's what his whole arc was about? And then Greyworm and the dothraki leave and they still send Jon up north? Why would they not just keep him around until after they left? What are the unsullied and dothraki going to do about it once they leave?And then Sansa still wants to north to be separate even though it's a northman who rules? And not just a northman, but her brother? And all the other kingdoms are okay with this? Even Dorne and the Iron Islands? The two kingdoms who have either been free longer than any other or have gone to war for their freedom the most?

I dont know what big of an ego you guys had to wrap this entire thing is six episodes when HBO offered you infinite and unlimited resources, we will never know.Lastly, just two small points out of the gazillion things that went wrong this season, I wanted to point out - Bran was always the raven claiming he can never even be a lord, and suddenly he's happy to become a king? Secondly, why the on earth did you guys waste soooo much time and efforts about Jon knowing the truth of his parents, being the rightful heir and what not if he was going to be sent to Nightwatch ALL OVER AGAIN with no name, no land -nothing, NOTHING. Dont you think, Bran being the no name raven warging dude, would have loved to grow some roots in one of the trees in the godswood tree there? What happened in your minds is something we will never know.

I'd rather watch Zoolander 2 on repeat, with the language set to Mandarin, than ever watch any of season 8 of GOT again. This was my favorite show ever, and one of the greatest shows of all time.

Also, WTF was with the chair moving scene, and the brothel discussion, couldn't we have had a longer conversation between Danny and Jon instead?

This can definitely remind us that no matter the budget, no matter how amazing the whole production was related to casting, visuals and sounds, you simple cannot end an 8 year story with 6 episodes that are full of blank space and inconsistencies with the main characters.

7392,"I'm making this review to vent about how disappointed I was. But this episode was supposed to be the climax of all the years we spent watching these characters and their building stories. Instead all we got was one anticlimactic conclusion after another, I will go point by point:-Dany gets killed 10 minutes into the 80 minute episode, nothing big happens after this. This was our ""climax"" of both Dany and Jon's stories, a quick shiv to the stomach-Jon gets sent back to the nights watch after killing Dany, where he becomes a wildling? His targaryen storyline goes nowhere! The only thing to happen from it is Varys gets killed because of it and Jon stops being with Dany because incest. He doesn't become king or even have a chance at it-Arya picks up and leaves everything and everyone she loves to just sail west. She just spent years and years fighting her way back to her family just to leave again. Not to mention her storyline with the faceless assassins was pointless because she never used the power and already knew how to fight before that-Tyrion was the worst in this season, every decision he made was the wrong one. He's supposed to be a clever character who knows his way around conversation, but he gets bested by everyone and everything in this season-Bran becomes king! Are you kidding me? The only thing he did for this show was get pushed out a window. He became the three-eyed raven and did nothing with it, he was by far the most useless character who just sat there and did nothing 100% of the time he was on screen-Varys's letters apparently meant nothing because nothing ever comes of it and it's never mentioned againOverall the ending message and overall tone felt nothing like a game of thrones episode, it felt like I was watching a stereotypical fantasy show. This show showed us that good guys don't always win, and bad guys win sometimes. But in the finale everything is wrapped up in a nice little bow for everyone and we're supposed to accept that these people who've been fighting for a constant 200+ years are perfectly cool coexisting and following bran the three eyed joke?

7395,"If you thought, that season 8 so far was so bad, that it could not possibly get any worse, consider your expectations subverted once again.
Not just character development, but what characters even are is forsaken. Dany is fine with being alone with armed John Snow, because the plot demands it. Dany just shrugs away burning children. John Snow is somehow kept alive both by Drogon and Grey Worm, despite killing their Mother/Queen, because his plot armor is just that strong. Dothraki inexplicably appear and equally inexplicably disappear as soon as they become inconvenient to the plot.
Tyrion delivers a sappy speech about Bran having the ""best story"" or something and Bran is elected King, because of that. And Sansa just says, that North is independent now and she is Queen and everyone is like ""Yeah, OK"". Somehow nothing matters. John being a Targaryen doesn't matter at all. Gendry being the son of king Robert doesn't matter at all. Bran being the 3-eyed raven, this alien godlike entity and the implication of putting it on the Throne, don't matter nearly enough.
Arya does nothing of significance. She was given this ridiculous plot armor in episode 5 for no reason at all!
The ending is unbelievably farcical. ""Bran the Broken"" indeed. That writers also,apparently, even inserted self-congratulating lines in this mess (""Nothing is as powerful,as a good story."") and one of them has said ""I'm hoping for the Breaking Bad argument where it's like, 'Is that an A or an A+?'"" is just mind-boggling.

1. 10/10 goes to the actors for their great work. 10/10 goest to people who were responsible for visual effects, CGI and so on. 10/10 goes to Ramin Djawadi.D&D only deserve exile in the Night´s Watch.2. I think all of us knew that GoT wouldn´t have happy ending. This world full of terrible medieval realism with some mysterious magic was not made for happy end in traditional sense. But those characters deserved much better fates. Jaime was the man of his word, he saved the King´s Landing by killing the mad king, he sweared to fight in the North and he kept his words. And all of his way, every transformation in his mind were about to lead him to this end. Cercei always had lust after power, she was doing terrible things, and she wasn´t very smart. D&D, YOU showed us her apathy when Tommen died. So who is the mad monster: Daenerys or Cercei? D&D wrote nothing what could show us why Dany became mad. Missandei and her dragon died, than Jon didnt give her his love? Is it reasons to become mad in GoT, really? Sansa (according to the show) has more reasons to be mad: her father was beheaded on her own eyes, she was forced to betray her family, she suffered from Joffrey, she lost her brother and mother than Little Finger betrayed her, she was violented and raped by Ramsey, the woman tried to help her in Winterfell was skinned. Oh, and what was her reaction when she was killing Bolton? She was smiling. And you, Benioff, you want to say that Dany's reaction on Viserys death was strange?3. I'm not the fan of Daenerys storyline in the show, although I really liked some moments. But there were really no cnonditions, no set ups for her character to become mad. You yourself decided to shoot 6 episodes, it was your choice. It would be better if you didn't spend your budget on Arya walks around King´s Landing, but focused on the plot with the insanity of Daenerys. But I understand why you did that. Indeed, in the script it is easier to write ""Arya walking through a burning city full of chaos, panic and horror"", than to think over and write a complex plot. Hope you are satisfied. Unfortunately, we are not. Emilia. we are so sorry, you did the great work, thank you.4. Poor Jon Snow. D&D, what kind of stupid and heartless men you are? I understand the drama of this character, I also didn't think that he will rule the 7 kingdoms, but his line in this season looks very senseless. He resurrected to kill Daenerys? It was the plan? The meaning of the fact that he was the son of Reagar Targaryen was that Jon was the Prince that was promised and he had to defeat the Night King. Why then was this whole idea that he is Targaryen? You have deprived this character of the opportunity to kill the the Night King, giving this role to Arya for the sake of the shock effect. Jon had to do it, then his line would not be so empty and meaningless.5. Sansa asked Bran for independence for the North. Why didn't the Iron Islands and Dorne ask for the same privileges? The Islanders also fought for Winterfell, Theon died defending Bran. Dorne has always been known as a recalcitrant kingdom, do I need to remind the words of the house Martell?6. Even the Bran line would make sense. The election of the king by influential lords has indeed taken place in our history. But here you are all messed up. Why did he say that his whole journey was to be king? It turns out that he knew everything, but did nothing to avoid the tragedy.The best series ended the worst ending. Not because of Bran is king or Dany is mad, but because of the plot lines of the characters led nowhere. I do not feel a bitter-sweet ending, I feel anger.",1,20 May 2019,0,1

7424,"Instead of just leaving this review at ""zomg this sucked"" I feel like this show was strong enough for 6 seasons that its finale deserves a more detailed review as to why. it. sucked. so. hard.-Walking. We had 80 minutes to wrap up all the plot lines, and D&D chose to spend 20 minutes of that precious time showing characters silently waking. Tyrion walking in ash. Jon walking in ash. Dany walking in ash. Given how hackneyed D&D's dialogue is, it's little mystery as to why they made this decision. The less talking, the less writing they had to do.-Tyrion finding his siblings' bodies. What purpose does this scene serve? We know they died. His character could have easily inferred they died. There could have been a one-line drop confirming this in some dialogue exchange later in the episode if needed. And what a tragedy, because it turns out all they had to do was stand 10 feet to the right to avoid being killed. They showed the entire keep collapsing last episode, but in this episode it looked like 25% had caved in. I literally laughed when I saw the gold hand. Did a high school freshman write this?-Jon still attempting to defend Dany. Like really bro? Still? Really? As such, his dialogue with Tyrion felt forced and useless. Tyrion should not have had to spend 6 minutes of crap dialogue to explain to Jon why Dany = bad. Jon watching her incinerate children should have been enough. Maybe? No? Oh, ok.-The fast forward to the council scene had my mind reeling. You're telling me Greyworm didn't straight up kill Jon after realizing he'd killed Dany? Ok fine, I'll suspend some disbelief there (Unsullied only kill on command, etc.) But why in the name of the 7 gods did he let his prisoner Tyrion pontificate for another 5 minutes about who to make king? He should have elbowed that dude in his little head.-Bran is king. This is a criticism that needs no explanation.-Everyone is just unanimously down with Bran for king? This kingdom that spent a decade fighting, that can't agree on any single thing was like, ""Aye."" And then Sansa declares independence and no one else does? Huh? Why didn't they all just agree to be sovereign? Makes no sense.-They banish Jon to the wall because Greyworm is sad...but then Greyworm leaves Westeros forever, thus rendering Jon's sentencing a completely moot point. Ok, sure.-Thank god that we got that scene showing Tyrion pushing chairs in. I was like, 'They better effing show this dude tidying up a room or this show has been meaningless' and they delivered, 10/10.-Podrick's 4th wall shattering smirk at the end was a slap in the face to the viewer. It felt like D&D straight mocking us.-""A Song of Ice and Fire herp derp derp."" I'm literally going to become a serial killer over this scene.-While I like Brienne's last scene, it was a reminder that her sex scene with Jaimie was literally useless.-Arya has shown 0 interest in sailing or adventuring, but now she's Christina Columbus. I actually don't totally hate this for her, but thought for sure she'd end up as Kingsguard, especially with her blood on the throne.-Jon's entire post-resurrection story arc was completely useless. It didn't matter that he was a Targaryen, or really that he was even alive. But I'm fine with him becoming a free person.I honestly can't imagine a worse ending for this show. So bad. One of the most tragic television stories of all time. In the words of Bobby Baratheon, ""Give me something for the pain and let me die.""",1,20 May 2019,0,2

7433,"Besides the acting and hard work from supporting staff,
plot-wise this was quite objectively a trainwreck.
Just because it's impossible to completely satisfy
all the fans doesn't magically make the last season good. I will give you just a couple examples of
how horrible the writing was.1. No ties to previous foreshadowing.
Sure this does happen to a lot of shows that
just don't know where to end and prolong their
lives just a bit too long. That is why it is bad.
None of the major prophecies kept relevance.
Cersei's death, Azor Ahai and the Prince that was Promised, etc.
If you say Bran was the Prince that was Promised
you just haven't seen the show.
No, the show does not have to follow all foreshadows.
But there should be some explanation,
not complete abandonment. It is just sloppy.2. Horrible Logic
Many of the scenes in the 8th season just don't make sense.
I'm talking about simple logic.
There is no reason for Tyrion to believe
Cersei would ever surrender.
In case of requesting for surrender,
you send a messanger or courier of some sort.
You do NOT expose the entire leadership
to a barrage of dragon killing scorpions.
And Cersei, or anyone with a functioning brain,
would have let them leave alive when
the opppsition has an army that could
ransack the city in less than a day.
Drogon or not, Cersei's army was decimated in 10 minutes.
The Ironbank would never have allowed a loan
enabling her to borrow the entire Golden Company.
Basic things just have no logic, no explanation,
and no common sense.3. Nonexistant Character Development.
Dany went bad. Sure, that happens. But not like this.
You want to see a good example of how to portray
a good person falling to the ""dark side,""
just watch ""Breaking Bad.""
Walter White going bad is a great example
of how to portray how the psyche of a man
changes while interacting with extremes in the environment.
Dany going berserk at the sight of the Red Keep,
after she's been flying around the city for at least an hour,
Missandei saying ""Drakaris"" as her last words,
Grey Worm obviously unleashing at innocent civilians,
Tyrion and Varis going stupid at the same time,
Jon Snow turning into a clueless fool,
Bran suddenly discarding all his values as the
Three-eyed Raven...
They could happen.
BUT
only with enough build-up that gives the characters
plausible cause to make such drastic changes.
If Batman suddenly started killing people
you can't just say ""Oh, he changed his mind""
and expect people to be happy.
I could go all day long but my point is that
these and a plethora of other flaws in the writing
would make any movie, any TV show horrible.
Sure, GoT is getting it worse because of the high
expectations of fans, but that does NOT
automatically make season 8 an objectively solid show.",1,20 May 2019,0,1

And the build up really was for nothing. The final season and in particular the final episode is a disaster in every sense. It shows that the writers don't understand what made the first few seasons gripping for fans. We related to the many characters' motivations and interactions as the story slowly unfolded. George RR Martin understands this well. But D&D just trashed this brilliant series. The characters are all one-dimensional now. No time for them to develop or for us to connect with them.

Jon Snow being a Targaryen was just a plot device.
I can't say it is how I would have done it but I also will respect the writers' decisions. Much will be made of Jon going back to the wall but over the show's history it is where he became who he is and he has a heart for the people there and the Wildlings. His ability to protect them when no one else will is his purpose. I really like how Arya's story ended, she has in the past mentioned exploring and asking what was west of Westeros and her character cannot sit still so with her last week deciding to give up her path of death this is a great moment for her character. There was no way to end a show like this and make everyone happy you can't develop so many beloved characters and get them all perfect for everyone but I think for the most parts everyone's resolutions fit in their character and anyone who has followed the show was foolish to expect a squeaky clean ending.",7,20 May 2019,0,6

7499,"I liked the finale. Especially after the last few terrible episodes. I think that they wrapped up the storylines that we cared about. It wasn't perfect, like the part where we didn't see anyone's reaction to Jon's actions against Dany, the fact that Brandon needed a master of whisperers despite the fact that he can ""see"" everything, and the council ""voting"" on a new ruler. But...they did justice to Sansa, Jon, Arya, and Tyrion. I was afraid that we would get a cheesy happy ending. Love did not win with Jon and Dany. Jamie did not miraculously survive and reunite with Brienne. Arya did not rule any kingdom (which wouldn't have suited her with OR without a mate.) Brienne made peace with Jamie's choice. The entry in the knight's register recorded his good deeds (there were some) while merely stating that he was loyal to his queen. Bran may have been the disappointing choice, but the way Tyrion presented it to the lords and ladies representing Westeros was logical. Sansa was true to her loyalty with the north, and did not compromise despite the fact that currently her brother would rule the other six kingdoms. Yara was represented and was still loyal to Dany (which was truly in character for her.) Jon went back to the Wall, and the free folk. He would never want to marry or father children anyway. The simple life of the north appealed to his nature and his lack of kingly ambition. All in all, I was pretty satisfied despite the rest of the season feeling rushed and disjointed. It was the best I could have hoped for, and ended positively, at least for me. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion though, and I respect that.",8,20 May 2019,0,8

7501,"This is my first review on imdb. I never write reviews. I've been using imdb for probably 15 years. This should give you an idea how bad this season and this episode was that I had to absolutely write down a review after a decade and half. I've been watching this show since day one. Though I had some complaints about season 7 but I still loved it. Overall I loved the show for 7 years and thought this show would go down in history as the most epic one and remain the gold standard! Unfortunately throughout season 8 after every single episode I used to think what have they done and can it get any worse? The finale proved that writers are fully capable of making the worst finale of the worst season. If ever there was an award for royally screwing up, D&D would win hands down. Please guys, sign the petition for season 8 remake. I think HBO should let Martin finish the books and then make season 8 again.",1,20 May 2019,0,1
7502,"I thought I was prepared after the irrational and disappointing episode 5, but the finale successfully reset my limit of disappointment again. Let's just say they broke all the characters, which is really hard to achieve after the marvelous season 1-6. In season 8 you can feel that it is not the character him/herself making the decision, it's somebody else making dumb decisions for them. I found it rather funny that at the end of the episode the writers try so hard to explain why something happened and convince the audiences it made sense.

7518,"Hello Lads and Laddies,English is not my mother tongue, but I try my best to show you how disappointed I am by this episode und season.First of all, I studied movie sciences - yeh, you can study that an can even get an MBA, PhD or Prof.Titel in this. So my view at this part of the story might be a little more complex an maybe slightly confusing.Second, an that's maybe the biggest whopper for most of you, is that I am totally okay for Bran at the Iron Throne. Why? Most viewers doesn't understand that Bran aka The Thre Eyed Raven isn't an complex figure in GoT. HE IS US! He ist the viewer. The passive observer in a so called lean-back-medium aka Television. He can't do anything but observe, he isn't the godlike storyteller. He ist US, and I have to give props to the in this season awful writers, they perfectly got that in the nothing-scene between Tyrion, Bronn, Brienne and Ser Davos.
D&D showing us a transformation from royal domination to a constitutional democracy, like the modern Great Britain. But it was painful to watch. Sansa burning her uncle was fun, Sam getting slapped wasn't comical as intended, but a dumb decision to reach into the actual state of US-policy.BUT. The rest oft this episode was so disappointing, with a few exceptions. I nerver likes Kit Harrington, King Whinyface. But in this episode he delivered... thanks to D&D for the ""good boy troll"". Emilia Clarke is a wonderful Dany, but a mediocre actor in every other show. Her transmutation from good to mad was believable for me.But^2 The pace is just wrong in every minute, the dialogues are absolutely cheesy to the max. Drogon doesn't kill Jon, simply because dragons don't kill Targaryens.The mayor disappointment is the conclusion of the story. It doesn't matter what you do or who you are. You can't brake the Wheel! Sansa was always destined to be a queen. Jon was always a bastard, and bastard serve at the wall. Targaryens are always mad. Lannisters are always intelligent and take the lead. The north follows the north, the south follows the King/Queen. The Unsullied are slaves to every righteous king.Years of charakter developement to only one point: It doesn't matter who you are, but what you are.PS. Ramin Djawadi did an awesome Emmy-worthy thing in The Long Night (he might got not nominated because of technialities), but the music in this episode wasn't very exciting.Thank you for reading this.Alex",1,20 May 2019,0,1

7520,"So, Game of Thrones, what to say about this show that hasn't already been said? The acting is phenomenal, the cinematography is some of the best ever put to any screen, the direction is suberb and the writing for the most part is really, really good. Now, the finale...
I know I'm not with the majority here, but I really thought this was a good conclusion and a fitting end. Now if you haven't seen the final episode of Game of Thrones stop reading this review now, final warning.
Jon kills Dany, Drogon burns The Iron Throne then flies away with Dany's corpse. Bran is chosen as the new king, Bronn is Master of Coin, Tyrion is named Hand, Sansa gets The North independent and names herself Queen of the North and Jon goes back to being Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. In my opinion this are all very fitting endings. Daenerys had to die after going mad and her death scene was very well acted by both Emilia Clarke and Kit Harrington. Jon's arc had been set up to go either ""The King's Journey"" or ""The Hero's Journey"" the writers chose The Hero's Journey where the Hero goes back to the place where his journey began, but he goes back with knowledge he acquired in his journey and honestly I thought that was fine, it was a good way to end Jon's arc. For those of you wonsering why they revealed Jon's lineage or why was he brought back from the dead if he wasn't going to serve a purpose, well he did have a purpose, killing Dany, that was the reason his lineage was revealed and that was the reason he was brought back from the dead, that was his destiny. In regards to Bran being king I don't have much to say, I never personally liked the Three Eyed Raven storyline but I thought this was a satisfying way to end things. Brienne writing Jaime's story I thought was a fantastic callback and her arc was one the show ended perfectly. However, I got two gripes with this episode, well, maybe three. One is Drogon, where is he? Couldn't they have added a scene of Bran seeing through Drogon's eyes to see where he was? Second, this might be me, but I thought the whole ""Song of Ice and Fire"" that Sam wrote was pretty cheesy. Third was the runtime, I thought the episode was a bit rushed and there were some bits of scenes that seemed to go on for a bit longer than they had to.In conclusion this season was by far the worst of the show, the writing was not the best and it felt rushed; but for a show as masterful as Game of Thrones that isn't saying much. This season might be the worst Game of Thrones season but it is still leagues ahead of most of the other shows on television. Just because the show didn't end the way you wanted it to end doesn't mean it's bad. Thanks Game of Thrones, for everything. Now our watch has ended.",8,20 May 2019,0,9
7521,"I won't lie, this finale could be much better designed. Many fans who expected fan service are just complaining about the conclusion of their favorite characters or the way that the entire last episode had no sense. Nevertheless, Game of Thrones it is known by changing the game the whole time. And come on, if you re-watch the series, you will notice that Daenerys doomed herself long time ago. I mean, I think the characters got a good plot finale executed in a really way that requires improvements. But still kept its Game of Thrones essence.",7,20 May 2019,0,6
7522,I was thinking that the any serie can make more errors thank The Walking Dead. But I never hope that HBO can kill the best serie in the world and just in one season. Please they need to make again when the writer finish the books. I can't believe that i was waiting the last two year for the season 8 for that.I am very sad!!!,1,20 May 2019,0,2
7525,"Ok, so i see a lot of people that give this episode a 1. First of all i don't agree, and we all have the right to give our opinion. The people that give this episode a 1 can't even give good reasons why it is that bad. Now don't get me wrong, this seas on was terrible, just really one of the biggest mess ups together with The Last Jedi, Justice League (and i am a DC fan) and Dexter. They obviously didn't take enough time to finish this beautiful masterpiece of a story. Instead they rushed it and destroyed it. But i already talked about that in my review for Episode 5 of this season called 'the most painful thing i ever watched', so check that out to see my opinion on that.Now lets get to why i think this is a good ending episode. The acting was on another level, Tyrion had amazing scenes with good dialog again. He finally felt like himself again. Same goes for Jon Snow. In my opinion i think it would have been to clishé to put him on the throne. The whole thing that this series has learned us is that everybody that has to much power and is obsessed with it, will eventually go mad or bad. This is actually relatable to the modern world. Money, power and fame make people change. Humans are weak when it comes to these things. This is why it makes so much sence to make Bran the King of the now Six Kingdoms. Bran didn't want the Throne. He never wanted power and never really had it (rember the first ever scene in winterfel?, it is when Bran is practising with shooting his bow but fails every attempt). And on top of that he became a cripple and the most important part: the Three Eyed Raven. He eventually isn't really a man anymore. He is incorruptable and therefor the most fit person to be the king. So yeah for al the people out there saying this was a bad choice. You are probably not paying enough attention to the message of GoT. But i think this one of the ending parts that Dan and Dave didn't make up themselfs but that George R R Martin told them.
Almost all characters get a good finish to their stories, IN THIS EPISODE ONLY. So again don't get me wrong cause i am still so angry about Jaime's and most of all Cersei's ending to their story. But by the way i have to mention that the scene with Tyrion taking the rocks off the bodies of his brother and sister were just very well done. This episode really played with your feelings and all the memories we have had with these characters. I am so happy with Bran as King. I first heard rumors of Gendry becoming the next king. Now if that would have happend it would have been a completly different story.Now about Deanerys death... i think the kill itself could have been filmed from better angles, but the music was just amazing and the acting as well. I really liked that she touched the throne but never got to sit on it. Also the part with Drogon burning the Throne wasn't a surprise but it just had to happen.Now some negative things about this episode. This episode made me think about all the characters that survived just because of the bad writing these last 2 seasons. Tormund is still alive for no reason (he should have died in epsidode 6 beyond the wall). Brienne should have died in Jaime's hands in the Long Night or in the battle for Kingslanding turning Jaime against Cersei. Jaime and Cersei most of all should have died completly different. I could go on. It's just annoying to see so many live when George RR Martin would have let those die because he does care about realistic story telling.But yeah, at the end of the day i will defend this episode. The most beautiful and emotional moment was with all the starks at the end. I had goosebumps and tears in my eyes.
I will remember this series as Amazing. And i am so grateful for the first 6 seasons. But this last season was such a dissapointment, i am just happy its now over, and looking forward to the prequel series without Dan and Dave!Thank you for not just following everybody else and taking time to read my opinion on this Episode",8,20 May 2019,0,5

7527,"Full disclosure, I turned it off 30 minutes before the end. There was nothing left in those 30 minutes that would redeem this storyline. I did see Bran the Useless get ""elected?"" King. Because all violent civil wars logically end in peaceful democratic elections...To be fair I have heard it argued that Bran was the only feasible choice at this point and perhaps that is true. Be that as it may, that was the result of absurd writing that left no other choices but to pull something out of left field in the finalé. The season had been completely off the rails since episode 8.3 and all this considered this wasn't the worst of them. However, the writing has left us in a wholly unsatisfyling place with the most pointless charachter, who has contributed literally nothing to the storyline this far, somehow ending up on what remains of the Iron Throne. The destruction of the Iron Throne and a cripple husk of a charachter ending up upon it is poetic justice for a series that started so brilliantly only to be left a smoulder pile of withered ash in the end.",6,20 May 2019,0,5

How can you end an action packed show with more action to come and have it move so slow you're actually waiting for it to get to the next scene.That's because the amount of plot was very limited. Everything was tidied up with almost no extra at all.Jon kills Dany the first time they're alone. Anti-climatic. Somehow we never hear about the Dothraki again ... like explaining why they didn't tear his body into tiny parts and eat it.Greyworm and the unsullied keep him locked up ... after killing their queen. Again, why is he alive?The council to pick a New king that was supposed to cover the 7 kingdoms seemed to be all northerns or minor houses that didn't even make up most of the kingdoms ... that weren't there.Bran said before he had no interest in ruling Winterfell ... he was beyond such things ... so instead he becomes king of the kingdoms ... except the north who wants to be free ... and for some reason none of the other kingdoms then want the same.It's said Bran can have no children, but the last 3 eyed raven lived for like 2000 years. So passing on the throne?Braun is master of coin ... the guy who is the biggest thief and wants to spend the money to rebuild brothels ... isn't that a way to say they're not taking the kingdom seriously from the start?And Jon Snow is allowed to go back to the Night's Watch ... again, why wouldn't the unsullied kill him? They're missing at least 1 big speech convincing Greyworm Dany was unhinged. Without that, it makes no sense.In the end Jon Snow rides off north, against the new vows he just took ... that didn't last long ...Sorry, too many holes to tie up to put all the characters where they turned up.
