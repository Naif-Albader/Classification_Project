# IMDB Seintment analysis (MVP):

### Goal the project:

> The primary goal of the project is to predict either the review is a positive review or negative review


### Training workflow:
> 1) EDA, to find anomalies in the data such as nulls
> 2) Feature engineering to enhance the model
> 3) The following models are used: <br>
> 3.1) Linear regression (Baseline) <br>
> 3.2) Random forest <br>
> 3.3) XGboost <br>
>4.4) Bagging Classifier 
>The best found wasBagging Classifier  achieving F1 score of 0.884
